Objective The present study investigated the role of QRFP in testicular steroidogenesis in mice. Materials and methods Both ex vivo and in vivo experiments were performed. For ex vivo, testicular tissues were cultured with 0, 10, 100 and 1000 nM QRFP, with or without hCG, for 6, 12 and 24 h, and media were used for testosterone assay. The hCG-stimulated testicular tissues were used for immunoblot of SF1, StAR, CYP11A1, 3 beta- and 17 beta-HSD. For in vivo, mice received bilateral intratesticular injection of saline or 0.3, 1 and 3nmol QRFP and were killed at 6, 12 and 24 h post-injection. Testosterone in serum was measured at above durations, while qRT-PCR of HMG-CoA synthase 1 and SR-B1 and immunoblot of steroidogenesis-related markers were performed at 24 h post-injection. Results Testosterone production under basal and hCG-stimulated conditions increased in a time-dependent manner, and QRFP supplementation to testicular culture caused an increase and a decrease in hormone production. The effect of QRFP on testosterone production under hCG-stimulated culture or in vivo conditions at 6 and 24h was similar. At 6h, testosterone production increased at 10 and 100 nM and also at 0.3 and 1nmol QRFP, while it decreased at 1000 nM and 3 nmol doses. At 24 h, testosterone level decreased at lower concentrations (10 nM and 0.3 nmol) and thereafter increased at middle (100nM and 1nmol) and higher (1000 nM and 3 nmol) concentrations under both hCG-stimulated culture and in vivo. Discussion and conclusion QRFP induced production of testosterone by modulating steroidogenic machinery at optimal doses and durations. Further, findings of in vivo study indicate that QRFP besides directly regulating testicular steroidogenesis may also have modulated other factors which act together in a holistic manner to control steroidogenesis.","[Patel, Shishir K.; Singh, Shio K.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Zool, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Singh, SK (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Zool, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",shioks@rediffmail.com,,"Patel, Shishir/0000-0002-2867-2293",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Indian Council of Medical Research [5/10/FR/12/2015-RBMH],Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Indian Council of Medical Research(Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)),"Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Indian Council of Medical Research, Grant/Award Number: 5/10/FR/12/2015-RBMH",,25,4,4,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2047-2919,2047-2927,,ANDROLOGY-US,Andrology,NOV,2020,8,6,,,,,1815,1823,,10.1111/andr.12864,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/andr.12864,,JUL 2020,9,Andrology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Endocrinology & Metabolism,ON9KM,32652859,,,,2022-12-21,WOS:000552650100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the present study, the approach of co-culture of rice (Oryza sativa) and Hydrilla verticillata was studied to evaluate arsenic toxicity amelioration in rice. Rice plants of two varieties, Pooja and CO-50, grown under As stress (25 mu M) for 10 d showed significant decline in growth, photosynthetic pigments and protein content while an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) and non-protein thiol (NP-SH) contents and guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) activity. The effects were attributable to significant As accumulation in both Pooja (185.35 mu g g(-1) dw in root and 23.49 mu g g(-1) dw in shoot) and CO-50 (846.61 mu g g(-1) dw in root and 167.32 mu g g(-1) dw in shoot). In rice-Hydrilla co-culture, significant improvement in growth and various biochemical parameters were observed in both varieties of rice as compared to As alone treatments. A significant decrease in As accumulation was also noticed in both Pooja (93.23 mu g g(-1) dw in root and 8.37 mu g g(-1) dw in shoot) and CO-50 (566.19 mu g g(-1) dw in root and 94.36 mu g g(-1) dw in shoot). Hydrilla plants itself showed significant As accumulation when grown in co-culture with Pooja (476.36 mu g g(-1) dw) or CO-50 (439.43 mu g g(-1) dw). In conclusion, the co-culture of hydrilla plants with rice can be used as a low-cost, sustainable and feasible technology to ameliorate As toxicity and to reduce As accumulation in rice.

The time dependent fluorescence studies suggested about the dynamic and static fluorescence quenching with F- and CN- anions. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and diffraction light scattering (DLS) experiments have been performed to understand the morphological behavior and particle size of the probe to distinguish both anions. Upon interaction with F- and CN- the morphology of probe reveals a clear shape reconstruction from the initial aggregated spherical ball shape to fine leaf like and dumbbell like structures, respectively by disaggregation to form minimum energy structures.

The proteins with high beta-sheet contents are more prone to form amyloids as they exhibit high propensity of self-aggregation. The self aggregated misfolded proteins act as template for further aggregation that leads to formation of protofilaments and eventually amyloid fibrils. More than 30 different types of proteins are known to be associated with amyloidosis related diseases. Several aspects of the amyloidogenic behavior of proteins remain elusive. The exact reason that causes misfolding of the protein and its association into amyloid fibrils is not known. These misfolded intermediates surpass the over engaged quality control system of the cell which clears the misfolded intermediates. This promotes the self-aggregation, accumulation and deposition of these misfolded species in the form of amyloids in the different parts of the body. The amyloid deposition can be localized as in Alzheimer disease or systemic as reported in most of the amyloidosis. The amyloidosis can be of acquired type or familial.

We have cloned and expressed PGK in Brugia malayi. The rBmPGK was found to be 415 amino acid residues long having 45 kDa subunit molecular weight. This enzyme was also identified in different life stages of bovine filarial parasite Setaria cervi. The enzyme activity was highest in microfilarial stage followed by adult female and male as also shown by real time PCR in the present study. Further using BmPGK primers the cDNA prepared from S. cervi was amplified and sequenced which showed 100% homology with Brugia malayi PGK. B. malayi and S. cervi, PGK consists of conserved calmodulin binding domain (CaMBD) having 21 amino acids. In the present study we have shown the CaMBD binds to calcium-calmodulin and regulates its activity. The binding of calmodulin (CaM) with CaMBD was confirmed using calmodulin agarose binding pull down assay, which showed that the rBmPGK binds to CaM agarose-calcium dependent manner. The effect of CaM-Ca2+ on the activity of rBmPGK was studied at different concentration of CaM (0.01-5.0 mu M) and calcium chloride (0.01-100 mu M). The rBmPGK was activated up to 85% in the presence of CaM at 1 mu M and 10 mu M concentration of CaCl2. Interestingly this activation was abrogated by metal chelator EDTA. Similar results were shown in case of Setaria cervi PGK. A significant increase (90 +/- 10) % in ScPGK activity was observed in the presence of CaM and CaCl2 at 1.0 mu M and 1.0 mM respectively, further increase in the conc. of CaCl2, the activity of ScPGK was found to be decreased like rBmPGK. Bioinformatics studies have also confirmed the interaction between CaMBD and CaM which showed CaM interacted to Phe 206, Gln 220, Arg 223 and Asn 224 of rBmPGK CaM binding domain. On the basis of these findings, it has been suggested that the activity of filarial PGK could be regulated in cells by Ca2+-CaM depending upon the concentration of calcium. To the best of our knowledge this is first report in filarial parasite. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

Hypoxia generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), causes oxidative stress and affects female reproductive health by altering ovarian as well as oocyte physiology in mammals. Hypoxic conditions lead to several degenerative changes by inducing various cell death pathways like autophagy, apoptosis and necrosis in the follicle of mammalian ovary. The encircling somatic cell death interrupts supply of nutrients to the oocyte and nutrient deprivation may result in the generation of ROS. Increased level of ROS could induce granulosa cells as well as oocyte autophagy. Although autophagy removes damaged proteins and subcellular organelles to maintain the cell survival, irreparable damages could induce cell death within intra-follicular microenvironment. Hypoxia-induced autophagy is operated through 5 ' AMP activated protein kinase-mammalian target of rapamycin, endoplasmic reticulum stress/unfolded protein response and protein kinase C delta-c-junN terminal kinase 1 pathways in a wide variety of somatic cell types. Similar to somatic cells, we propose that hypoxia may induce granulosa cell as well as oocyte autophagy and it could be responsible at least in part for germ cell elimination from mammalian ovary. Hypoxia-mediated germ cell depletion may cause several reproductive impairments including early menopause in mammals.","[Yadav, Anil Kumar; Yadav, Pramod K.; Chaudhary, Govind R.; Tiwari, Meenakshi; Gupta, Anumegha; Sharma, Alka; Pandey, Ashutosh N.; Chaube, Shail K.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Zool, Cell Physiol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Pandey, Ajai K.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Fac Ayurveda, Dept Kayachikitsa, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Chaube, SK (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Zool, Cell Physiol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",shailchaubey@gmail.com,"Chaube, Shail/ABC-1337-2020; Yadav, Pramod Kumar/T-4849-2019","Yadav, Pramod Kumar/0000-0003-0406-5701; /0000-0002-1348-4273; YADAV, ANIL/0000-0002-6415-8099","Centre of Advanced Study, Department of Zoology, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, UP, India","Centre of Advanced Study, Department of Zoology, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, UP, India","The laboratory is supported by Centre of Advanced Study, Department of Zoology, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi-221005, UP, India.",,168,31,37,0,18,SPRINGER BASEL AG,BASEL,"PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND",1420-682X,1420-9071,,CELL MOL LIFE SCI,Cell.

Mortality due to amebiasis is mostly by extra intestinal infections, amebic liver abscess being the most common one. This study was conducted to determine the current epidemiological status, risk factors, associated microflora and strain variation of E. histolytica causing liver abscesses. Methods/Findings A total of 115 liver abscess cases comprising of 107 (93%) males and 8 (6.9%) females were included in the study. Microscopic examination of pus samples from the abscesses and species discrimination using nested multiplex PCR showed the presence of E. histolytica in 101 (87.5%) cases. Data collected by face to face interviews using a pre tested questionnaire suggested intake of untreated drinking water (ORs: 6.4, p = 0.002), habit of alcohol consumption (ORs: 4.0, p = 0.019) and lack of urban services (ORs: 0.08, p = 0.017) to be major risk factors associated with E. histolytica infections. The study of associated bacterial flora through aerobic culture of liver aspirates and conventional PCR for detection of anaerobes revealed the presence of Fusobacterium (19, 25.5%), Peptococcus (19, 25.5%), Prevotella (18, 24.3%), Bacteroides (8, 10.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (3, 4%), Escherichia coli (2, 2.7%), Peptostreptococcus (2, 2.7%), Clostridium (2, 2.7%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1, 1.3%). Further to study the clonality, genotyping of E. histolytica targeting six tRNA-linked polymorphic STR loci (A-L, D-A, N-K, R-R, S-TGA -D and S-Q) was carried out which showed the presence of 89 different genotypes in the liver aspirate samples. Conclusion The findings highlight the high prevalence of genetically diverse E. histolytica from the liver abscess cases in this geographical region. Low socio-economic status and habit of alcohol consumption were important predictors of amebic liver abscess.","[Singh, Aradhana; Banerjee, Tuhina] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Microbiol, Varanasi, UP, India; [Kumar, Raju; Shukla, Sunit Kumar] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Gastroenterol, Varanasi, UP, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Banerjee, T (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Microbiol, Varanasi, UP, India.",drtuhina@yahoo.com,"Banerjee, Tuhina/AAP-7084-2021","Banerjee, Tuhina/0000-0003-0035-2842",,,,,27,16,17,0,4,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,APR 3,2019,14,4,,,,,,,e0214880,10.1371/journal.pone.0214880,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0214880,,,14,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,HR5NS,30943253,"Green Published, gold",,,2022-12-21,WOS:000463194300068,View Full Record in Web of Science

Concentrations of Cr, Cd, Pb, Ni, Cu, and Fe in water have exceeded their respective standards in the middle and lower reaches of the river. Sediment Cr and Ni have reached probable effective concentration (PEC) at Kannauj, imposing likely threats to sediment dwellers. Highest I-geo values were recorded for Cr, Cd, and Pb at Kannauj, Rajghat, and Howrah. We further tested ecological risks (E-r) and potential ecological risks (PERI) to assess individual and cumulative effects and found the Kannauj, Rajghat, and Howrah sites under the high-risk category.

Experimental set up used to analyze the proteome were- a sudden shift to low temperature (i.e., cold shock), after short- (8 days) and long-term acclimation (7 weeks) to low temperature (5 degrees C). Cold-shock resulted in an increase in Low molecular weight proteins (LMWPs) with clouding of diffused proteins. Further increase in the duration of incubation period (short- and long-term acclimation) caused dissociation of proteins, indicated by NaCl (50-600mM) induced dissociation of proteins. That is, high molecular weight proteins (HMWPs) dissociated into LMWPs resulting in an increased number of protein bands. This was further confirmed by addition of LMWPs (<= 10KDa) resulting in re-association of proteins into HMWPs.

Women are more frequently exposed to several stressors during their reproductive age that trigger generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Accumulation of ROS in the body causes oxidative stress (OS) and adversely affects ovarian functions. The increased OS triggers various cell death pathways in the ovary. Beside apoptosis and autophagy, OS trigger necroptosis in granulosa cell as well as in follicular oocyte. The OS could activate receptor interacting protein kinase-1(RIPK1), receptor interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) to trigger necroptosis in mammalian ovary. The granulosa cell necroptosis may deprive follicular oocyte from nutrients, growth factors and survival factors. Under these conditions, oocyte becomes more susceptible towards OS-mediated necroptosis in the follicular oocytes. Induction of necroptosis in encircling granulosa cell and oocyte may lead to follicular atresia. Indeed, follicular atresia is one of the major events responsible for the elimination of majority of germ cells from cohort of ovary. Thus, the inhibition of necroptosis could prevent precautious germ cell depletion from ovary that may cause reproductive senescence and early menopause in several mammalian species including human.","[Chaudhary, Govind R.; Yadav, Pramod K.; Yadav, Anil K.; Tiwari, Meenakshi; Gupta, Anumegha; Sharma, Alka; Pandey, Ashutosh N.; Chaube, Shail K.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Zool, Cell Physiol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Pandey, Ajai K.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Fac Ayurveda, Dept Kayachikitsa, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Chaube, SK (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Zool, Cell Physiol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",shailchaubey@gmail.com,"Chaube, Shail/ABC-1337-2020; Chaube, Shail K/O-3558-2019; Yadav, Pramod Kumar/T-4849-2019","Yadav, Pramod Kumar/0000-0003-0406-5701; /0000-0002-1348-4273; YADAV, ANIL/0000-0002-6415-8099","Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India [EMR/2014/000702]","Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India(Department of Science & Technology (India))","This article is supported by Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India (Grant No. EMR/2014/000702).",,78,21,23,3,11,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1021-7770,1423-0127,,J BIOMED SCI,J.

A number of parameters such as physiological, biochemical, molecular of plants are affected under stress condition. Since the use of inorganic fertilizers and pesticides in agriculture practices cause degradation of soil fertility and environmental pollutions. Hence it is necessary to develop safer and sustainable means for agriculture production. The application of plant growth promoting microbes (PGPM) and mycorrhizal fungi enhance plant growth, under such conditions. It offers an economically fascinating and ecologically sound ways for protecting plants against stress condition. PGPM may promote plant growth by regulating plant hormones, improve nutrition acquisition, siderophore production and enhance the antioxidant system. While acquired systemic resistance (ASR) and induced systemic resistance (ISR) effectively deal with biotic stress. Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) enhance the supply of nutrients and water during stress condition and increase tolerance to stress. This plant-microbe interaction is vital for sustainable agriculture and industrial purpose, because it depends on biological processes and replaces conventional agriculture practices. Therefore, microbes may play a key role as an ecological engineer to solve environmental stress problems. So, it is a feasible and potential technology in future to feed global population at available resources with reduced impact on environmental quality. In this review, we have attempted to explore about abiotic and biotic stress tolerant beneficial microorganisms and their modes of action to enhance the sustainable agricultural production.","[Kumar, Akhilesh; Verma, Jay Prakash] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev, Varanasi 221005, UP, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Verma, JP (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev, Varanasi 221005, UP, India.",verma_bhu@yahoo.co.in,"VERMA, JAY PRAKASH/AAM-8143-2020",,DIC-BHU; DBT; DST-NRDMS,DIC-BHU; DBT(Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India); DST-NRDMS,"Authors thanks to funding agency DIC-BHU, DBT and DST-NRDMS for providing fund for starting research work on climate resilient strains or stress tolerant strains for sustainable agricultural production.",,134,217,228,47,313,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",0944-5013,1618-0623,,MICROBIOL RES,Microbiol.

Across the seasons and the land uses, the proportion of macro- and microaggregates was maximum at upper and minimum at lower layer whereas mesoaggregates increase with depth. The trend of macro- and microaggregate fractions through the soil profile was NF > JP > DF > CL whereas that of mesoaggregates was CL > DF < JP > NF. Dry mean weight diameter was highest at upper layer and decreased down the depth in all the land uses and followed the trend NF > JP > DF > CL. Aggregate associated organic carbon (OC) concentration in all the fractions decreased from NF to DF, CL, or JP indicates that macroaggregate associated OC concentration was more susceptible to loss than that of meso- and microaggregate associated OC concentration. LUC induced decline in macroaggregate associated OC stock and increase in meso- and microaggregate associated OC stock; indicated redistribution of OC stock among aggregate fractions. It may be concluded that JP in dry tropics can be an efficient strategy for rehabilitation of degraded land as it improves aggregate structure and stability in the whole profile and aggregate associated OC stock in upper layer of soil.","[Singh, Mahesh Kumar; Singh, Sunil; Ghoshal, Nandita] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Bot, Ctr Adv Study Bot, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Singh, Mahesh Kumar; Singh, Sunil; Ghoshal, Nandita] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Bot, Ctr Adv Study Bot, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Ghoshal, N (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Bot, Ctr Adv Study Bot, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",nghoshal.bhu@gmail.com,"Singh, Major/P-9790-2019; Singh, Sunil/AAV-1677-2021","Singh, Major/0000-0002-0247-861X; ","University Grants Commission, New Delhi, India","University Grants Commission, New Delhi, India(University Grants Commission, India)","We thank the Head and the Coordinator, Centre of Advanced Study in Botany, Department of Botany, for providing required facilities and University Grants Commission, New Delhi, India for University Research Fellowship to M.K.S. and Teacher Fellowship under FIP Scheme to S.S.",,50,17,17,4,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1061-2971,1526-100X,,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

Testis also is considered as a thyroid hormone responsive organ. Though THs play an important role in regulation of testicular steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis, the exact mechanism of this regulation remains poorly understood. The present study, therefore, is designed to examine the effect of neonatal hypothyroidism on prepubertal Parkes (P) strain mice testis in relation to thyroid hormone receptor alpha 1 (THR alpha 1). Hypothyroidism was induced by administration of 6-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU) in mother's drinking water from birth to day 28; on postnatal day (PND) 21 only pups, and on PND 28, both pups and lactating dams were euthanized. Serum T-3 and T-4 were markedly reduced in pups at PND 28 and in lactating mothers, while serum and intra-testicular testosterone levels were considerably decreased in pups of both age groups. Further, serum and intra-testicular levels of estrogen were significantly increased in hypothyroid mice at PND 28 with concomitant increase in CYP19 expression. Histologically, marked changes were noticed in testes of PTU-treated mice; immunohistochemical and western blot analyses of testes in treated mice also revealed marked decrease in the expression of THR alpha 1 at both age groups. Semiquantitative RT-PCR and western blot analyses also showed reductions in both testicular mRNA and protein levels of SF-1, StAR, CYP11A1 and 3 beta-HSD in these mice.

We report here the petrology and geochemistry of two undeformed and unmetamorphosed lamprophyre dykes from the Mudigubba area located immediately towards the western margin of the Paleo-Mesoproterozoic Cuddapah basin from this craton. The Mudigubba lamprophyres are free from crustal xenoliths, and have a typical porphyritic-panidiomorphic texture predominated by phenocrysts of amphibole. Clinopyroxene occurs as microphenocrysts with feldspar essentially confined to the groundmass. F-rich apatite and sphene are the other accessories. Mineral chemistry reveals that the amphiboles are of calcic variety (dominantly magnesio-hornblende), the clinopyroxene to be a diopside (Wo(45.01-50.40) En(36.74-44.58) Fs(6.79-12.73) AC(0.42-2.24)) and the albitic (Or(1.12) Ab(91.17)An(7.70)) nature of the feldspar. The lower abundance of TiO2 in both the amphibole and clinopyroxene, suggest a calc-alkaline nature of the magma. High Mg# (76.8-79.3), Ni (140-240 ppm) and Cr (380-830 ppm) contents along with (i) depletion in U, and Th, (ii) variable Ba/La and (iii) low Nb/La as well as Th/La strikes out possibility of crustal contamination and supports the primary nature of the lamprophyre magma. The presence of significant Nb-Ta, Zr-Hf and Ti negative anomalies in the primitive mantle normalized multi-element plots and their striking similarity with the global talc-alkaline lamprophyres imply the involvement of subduction-related mantle source modification. Various geochemical ratios (e.g., Hf/Sm, Ta/La, Th/Yb, Nb/Yb, La/Nb, Ba/Nb) demonstrate the source enrichment was caused by a fluid-related, rather than silicate-melt related, subduction metasomatism. Binary-mixing calculations assuming average upper crust and N-MORB as the two end members reveals similar to 10-30% influx of subducted component in the generation of the Mudigubba lamprophyres. A re-examination of the limited geochemical data available for the co-spatial Paleoproterozoic (2200-1600 Ma) alkaline plutons suggests this Neoarchaean subduction-event in this domain could in fact be a regional feature - all along the western margin of the Cuddapah basin and represents a hitherto unrecognised suture zone in the eastern Dharwar craton with the Paleoproterozoic (?) emplacement of Mudigubba lamprophyres post-dating this collisional event. Our findings provide significant geochemical support to the models invoking convergence towards the evolution of the Eastern Dharwar craton and impose important constraints on the geodynamics of the southern peninsular India.

Based on the concept of Landau-de-Gennes formalism, the free-energy density of the system has been written as an expansion series in powers of relevant order parameters and their coupling terms. Adopting usual method, we have evaluated the values of spontaneous polarization (P-s) and relative temperature (T - T-c) as a function of tilt angle for seven SSFLCs materials. In case of materials exhibiting second-order transition a wide temperature variation in the tilt angle has clearly been observed. For materials showings first-order transition, the transition enthalpy has been found to be directly related to the Landu coefficient (b) associated with cubic power of orientational order parameter. We have found a close agreement between theory and experiment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We also assessed the trophic status of the river as influenced by such sources of nutrient input. Although the river N, P, and productivity showed a declining trend with increasing discharge, runoff DOC and dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) increased by 88.05 and 122.7% between the Adpr and Rjht sites, indicating contributions from atmospheric deposition (AD) coupled with land use where agriculture appeared to be the major contributor. Point source input led to increased river concentrations of NO3-, NH4+, DRP, and DOC by 10.5, 115.9, 115.2, and 67.3%, respectively. Increases in N, P, and productivity along the gradient were significantly negatively correlated with river discharge (p < 0.001), while river DOC and dissolved silica showed positive relationships. The results revealed large differences in point and non-point sources of carbon and nutrient input into the Ganga River, although these variations were strongly influenced by the seasonality in surface runoff and river discharge. Despite these variations, N and P concentrations were sufficient to enhance phytoplankton growth along the study stretch. Allochthonous input together with enhanced autotrophy would accelerate heterotrophic growth, degrading the river more rapidly in the near future. This study suggests the need for large-scale inter-regional time series data on the point and non-point source partitioning and associated food web dynamics of this major river system.","[Yadav, Amita; Pandey, Jitendra] Banaras Hindu Univ, Ganga River Ecol Res Lab, Environm Sci Div, Ctr Adv Study Bot,Inst Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Pandey, J (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Ganga River Ecol Res Lab, Environm Sci Div, Ctr Adv Study Bot,Inst Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",jiten_pandey@rediffmail.com,,,"Banaras Hindu University-University Grants Commission, New Delhi","Banaras Hindu University-University Grants Commission, New Delhi","The authors are thankful to the Coordinator, Centre of Advanced Study in Botany, Banaras Hindu University for facilities and to Banaras Hindu University-University Grants Commission, New Delhi, for funding support as fellowship to A.Y.",,76,23,23,3,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-6369,1573-2959,,ENVIRON MONIT ASSESS,Environ.

NtcA regulates the concentration dependent iron uptake by controlling the expression of furA gene. NtcA also regulated pigment synthesis and phenotypic alterations in Anabaena 7120. A significant increase in ROS production and corresponding reduction in the activities of antioxidative enzymes (SOD, CAT, APX and GR) in CSE2 mutant strain in contrast to wild type Anabaena 7120 also suggested the possible involvement of NtcA in protection against oxidative stress in iron deficiency. NtcA has no impact on the expression of furB and furC in spite of presence of consensus NtcA binding site (NBS) and -10 boxes in their promoter. NtcA also regulates the thylakoid arrangement as well as related photosynthetic and respiration rates under iron deficiency in Anabaena 7120.

Essential oil bearing plants can grow safely in soil contaminated with heavy metals without severe effects on morphology and oil yield. The present study was aimed to assess the essential oil content and composition in lemongrass in response to elevated metals in above-ground plant parts. Pot experiment was conducted for six months using sewage sludge as soil amendment (soil: sludge: 2:1 w/w) followed by red mud treatments (0, 5,10 and 15% w/w). Garden soil without sludge and red mud was control and there were ten replicates of each treatment. Oil content in leaves was differently affected due to presence of metals in soil under different treatments. Oil content under S-RM5 (5% red mud) treatment was raised by 42.9 and 11.5% compared to the control and S-RM0 treatment, respectively. Among identified compounds in oil under red mud treatments, 17 compounds contributed more than 90% of total volatiles (citral contributing approximately 70%). Under S-RM10 treatment, essential oil showed maximum citral content (75.3%). Contents of Fe, Zn, Cu, Cd, Ni and Pb in above-ground plant parts exceeded, whereas Mn was detected within WHO permissible limits for medicinal plants. However, metal contents in essential oil were well within FSSAI limits for food. The study suggests utilization of 5 and 10% red mud in sludge amended soil for lemongrass cultivation to have better oil yield and quality, without metal contamination. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present report, we have studied the kinetics of glass/crystal phase transformation in novel synthesized glasses of STSA system. For this, purpose, differential scanning calorimetric technique has been employed at four different heating rates (5, 10, 15, 20 K min(-1)). This paper explores the thermal analysis of calorimetric data using both advanced iso-conversional methods for the determination of effective activation energy as a function of extent of crystallization and classical non-isothermal methods for the determination of over-all crystallization activation energy.

Present study was designed to investigate the relative response of these stress hormones during water and food deprivation. In this study, male laboratory mice of Swiss strain were divided in 5 groups, control - provided water and food ad libitum, two experimental groups water deprived for 2 and 4 days respectively (WD2 and WD4) and another two groups food deprived for 2 and 4 days respectively (FD2 and FD4). Results indicate an increased expression of AVP mRNA as well as peptide in the hypothalamus of WD2 mice and the expression was further upregulated after 4 days of water deprivation but the expression of CRH remained unchanged compare to their respective controls. On the other hand no change was observed in the expression of hypothalamic AVP mRNA while AVP peptide increased significantly in FD2 and FD4 mice compare to control. Further, the expression of CRH mRNA although increased in hypothalamus of both FD2 and FD4 mice, the immunofluorescent staining shows decreased expression of CRH in PVN of food deprived mice. Based on these findings it is concluded that since during osmotic stress only AVP expression is upregulated but during metabolic stress i.e. food deprivation transcription and translation of both the stress hormones are differentially regulated. Further, it is suggested that role of AVP and CRH may be stress specific. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Activities of antioxidant enzymes, e. g., superoxide dismutase, catalase, and level of lipid peroxidation were found to be higher in the fish collected from the river showing pollutant-induced oxidative stress in the fish. Disturbed health status of the river fish was also manifested by increased activities of aspartate amino transferase, alanine amino transferase, and alkaline phosphatase.

MOF-5 and Au NPs incorporated MOF-5 (Au-MOF-5) are synthesized and characterized by UV-vis absorption, powder X-ray diffraction, FT-IR, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray analysis and elemental mapping, transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Oxidation of nitrite is effectively electrocatalyzed at Au-MOF-5 with significant increase in oxidation current (41 and 38% in comparison with bare glassy carbon (GC) and MOF-5 coated GC (GC/MOF-5) electrodes, respectively) and with considerable decrease in the oxidation potential (0. 17 and 0.25 V in comparison with bare GC and GC/MOF-5 electrodes, respectively). The electrocatalytic reduction of nitrobenzene at GC/Au-MOF-5 is confirmed by an appreciable increase in the reduction current (79 and 36% in comparison with bare GC and GC/MOF-5 electrodes, respectively) and a small shift in the reduction potential (20 mV in comparison with GC/MOF-5). The detection limit is calculated as 1.0 mM with a sensitivity of 0.23 mu A mu M (1) cm (2) for nitrite and 15.3 mu M with a sensitivity of 0.43 mu A mu M (1)cm (2) for nitrobenzene determinations. The Au-MOF-5 based electrochemical sensing platform shows high stability and selectivity even in the presence of several interferences (including phenols, inorganic ions and biologically important molecules) with a broad calibration range. Certain kinetic parameters of nitrite oxidation and nitrobenzene reduction have also been studied by hydrodynamic voltammetry. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Presently available asthma medications ameliorate inflammations but are unable to prevent or reverse the airway remodelling process as most of the treatment strategies are only focused on inflammation instead of remodelling. Methods: Curcumin, a phytochemical present in the rhizome of Curcuma Tonga is well known for its anti-inflammatory activity; however, the main drawback is its poor bioavailability which limits its therapeutic approval. So, the effect of nasal curcumin on acute and chronic asthma has been studied where short exposure to ovalbumin (4 days) represents acute phase whereas repeated exposures for longer (twice per week till 5 weeks) represents chronic asthma. Disodium cromoglycate (DSCG, 50 mg/kg, i.p.) and dexamethasone (1 mg/kg, i.p.) were used as standard drugs in acute and chronic model of asthma respectively. Results: OVA-induced airway inflammation initiated in acute stage led to remodelling due to persistent inflammation, epithelial and sub epithelial thickening (smooth muscle thickening), extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus plug formation. Intranasal curcumin is effective in inhibiting airway inflammation and remodelling both by maintaining the structural integrity of lungs in terms of inflammation, airway wall thickening and mucus production. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that curcumin administered through nasal route might prove therapeutically efficient in inhibiting allergic airway inflammations and maintaining structural integrity in the mouse model of allergic asthma. This may lead to the development of curcumin aerosol in near future. (C) 2016 SEICAP. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights reserved.","[Subhashini; Chauhan, P.

It binds selectively with Al3+ ions and a strong fluorescence signal is displayed from [NLAC-Al3+] ensemble and has also been supported by DFT calculation. The color change of NLAC in presence of Al3+ ions is further corroborated by UV-visible and fluorescence spectral titrations. The spectral changes are significant in the visible region of the spectrum and enable the detection of Al3+ ions with naked eye. The 1:1 stoichiometry of NLAC:Al3+ is supported by Job's plot and ESI-MS data. The fluorescence signal displayed from [NLAC-Al3+] is quenched on the addition of N-3(-) ions as an aqueous solution of NaN3 salt which reverts back further on the addition of Al3+ ions. This recognition process is also displayed in a human cervical cancer cell lines (SiHa cells) in an aqueous-acetonitrile medium. The process is repeated several times showing that the system is robust and reversible in the recognition process. A strip tests supports its feasibility for the laboratory demonstration.

Apart from the reduced emission rate than the fossil fuels, bioenergy has also immense potential to mitigate various environmental issues and therefore the biofuel cultivation has been considered as an additional opportunity for land restoration. However, the land availability for bioenergy production is very limited since there is a growing demand to produce more food to feed the rapidly growing population. Therefore, the arable lands cannot be considered for bioenrgy production. Hence we propose that the sustainable intensification of bioenergy production from degraded land is a viable option because the wise and judicious utilization of marginal and degraded lands can play a vital role in solving the conflict between food and fuel production and offer a sustainable solution to meet out the energy requirement of the society. In this backdrop, the present article is aimed to explore the prospects and promises of bioenergy production from the marginal and degraded lands of India. Since India has around 39.24 million hectares of wastelands, sustainable utilization of such land would provide multipurpose benefits such as biomass and bioenergy production, soil carbon sequestration and regaining ecosystem services.

Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) biplot analyses were used to assess the relation between soil bacterial population and its physicochemistry. DCA analysis exhibited a strong dependence of bacterial existence on the soil physicochemical variables, such as organic matter, total nitrogen, inorganic nutrients, temperatures, and moisture status. Soil dehydrogenase activity (DHA) was assessed to check the metabolic activity of all soil samples which showed a range of 0.012-0.050nmol TPF g(-1)min(-1) with significant variation (p<0.01). Out of 96 bands excised, 45 different phylotypes were obtained using both techniques which elucidated the abundance of Cyanobacteria over other soil bacterial population. Scytonema sp., Leptolyngbya sp. and different uncultured cyanobacterial species were the major genera found. Profiling data obtained through PCR-DGGE and RISA were used in alpha diversity and rarefaction curve analysis suggested site 6 (Chandauli) as the most diversity rich site. Thus extensive dataset of weighted and unweighted variables generated through DGGE and RISA coupled with metabolic functioning of soil and multivariate analyses provided an excellent opportunity to map the soil microbial structure in paddy fields and their regulation with existing soil environment.","[Srivastava, Meenakshi; Kaushik, Manish Singh; Mishra, Arun Kumar] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Bot, Lab Microbial Genet, Varanasi 221005, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Mishra, AK (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Bot, Lab Microbial Genet, Varanasi 221005, India.",akmishraau@rediffmail.com,,"Mishra, Arun Kumar/0000-0001-6096-8097; SRIVASTAVA, MEENAKSHI/0000-0002-0010-8850","Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, New Delhi, India [38(1316)/12/EMR-II]; UGC; CSIR, New Delhi","Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, New Delhi, India(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India); UGC(University Grants Commission, India); CSIR, New Delhi(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India)","This study has been supported by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, New Delhi, India [38(1316)/12/EMR-II].

These proteins are having less than 20% sequence similarity among paralogs. Experimentally identifying them is an expensive and time consuming process. The computational methods based on the sequence similarity for allocating putative members to this family are also far elusive due to the low sequence similarity existing among the members of this family. Consequently, the machine learning methods become a viable alternative for their prediction by using the underlying sequence/structurally derived features as the input. Ideally, any machine learning based prediction method must be trained with all possible variations in the input feature vector (all the sub-class input patterns) to achieve perfect learning. A near perfect learning can be achieved by training the model with diverse types of input instances belonging to the different regions of the entire input space. Furthermore, the prediction performance can be improved through balancing the training set as the imbalanced data sets will tend to produce the prediction bias towards majority class and its sub-classes. This paper is aimed to achieve (i) the high generalization ability without any classification bias through the diversified and balanced training sets as well as (ii) enhanced the prediction accuracy by combining the results of individual classifiers with an appropriate fusion scheme. Instead of creating the training set randomly, we have first used the unsupervised Kmeans clustering algorithm to create diversified clusters of input patterns and created the diversified and balanced training set by selecting an equal number of patterns from each of these clusters. Finally, probability based classifier fusion scheme was applied on boosted random forest algorithm (which produced greater sensitivity) and K nearest neighbour algorithm (which produced greater specificity) to achieve the enhanced predictive performance than that of individual base classifiers. The performance of the learned models trained on Kmeans preprocessed training set is far better than the randomly generated training sets. The proposed method achieved a sensitivity of 90.6%, specificity of 91.4% and accuracy of 91.0% on the first test set and sensitivity of 92.9%, specificity of 96.2% and accuracy of 94.7% on the second blind test set. These results have established that diversifying training set improves the performance of predictive models through superior generalization ability and balancing the training set improves prediction accuracy. For smaller data sets, unsupervised Kmeans based sampling can be an effective technique to increase generalization than that of the usual random splitting method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, less information exist regarding the age-dependent variation in local melatonin (IMel) concentration and MT1R expression in testis and its interaction with testicular steroidogenesis and nitro-oxidative stress in golden hamster, Mesocricetus auratus. Therefore, we evaluated IMel level along with MT1R expression and its possible interaction with steroidogenesis and nitro-oxidative stress in testes of young (6 weeks), adult (15 weeks) and old (2 years) aged hamsters, further, we injected the old hamsters with melatonin to address whether age-related decline in IMel and MT1R is responsible for the reduction in testicular steroidogenesis and antioxidant status. Increased expression of steroidogenic markers suggests increased testicular steroidogenesis in adult hamsters that declined in old hamsters. An age-dependent elevation in the level of NOX,TBARS, corticosterone and the expression of iNOS and GR with a concomitant decrease in enzyme activities for SOD, CAT, GSH-PX indicate increased nitro-oxidative stress in testes. Data suggest that reproductive senescence in male hamsters might be a consequence of declined IMel concentration with MT1R expression inducing nitro-oxidative stress resulting in diminished testicular steroidogenesis. However, administration of Mel in old-aged hamsters significantly increased steroidogenesis and antioxidant status without a significant variation in IMel concentration and MT1R expression in testes. Therefore, decreased IMel and MT1R might not be the causative factor underlying the age-associated decrease in antioxidant defence and steroidogenesis in testes.

It was found that irrespective of the evolutionary divergence among the species, FA which is reflective of the developmental precision remains nearly same in four species. During the present study, the level of FA in different morphological traits was studied in interspecific hybrids and compared with that of parental species with the view that it would throw light on the degree of divergence between the parental species. If they have not diverged much, the interspecific hybrids may have a similar FA level, incompatibilities between their genomes being negligible. On the other hand, if there is substantial divergence, the level of FA may be higher due to incompatibility between the genomes of the parental species. The morphological traits taken were sternopleural bristle number and wing length in both males and females and ovariole number and sex-comb tooth number in females and males respectively. However, except in a few cases, we could not detect any significant differences in the level of FA in hybrids as compared to pure species. On the other hand, a number of abnormalities like poor viability, dystrophied ovaries, asymmetrical eyes etc., could be detected in hybrids from crosses involving D. pseudoananassae as one of the parents. Therefore, we conclude that specific developmental pathways are more susceptible to developmental disturbances due to genomic incompatibilities than the large complex system bringing about developmental stability.","[Banerjee, Parul; Singh, B.

Drosophila malpighian tubules (MTs), however, are unique immune organs that show constitutive expression of AMPs even in unchallenged conditions and the onset of immune response is developmental stage dependent. Earlier reports have shown ecdysone positively regulates immune response after pathogenic challenge however, a robust response requires prior potentiation by the hormone. Here we provide evidence to show that MTs do not require prior potentiation with ecdysone hormone for expression of AMPs and they respond to ecdysone very fast even without immune challenge, although the different AMPs Diptericin, Cecropin, Attacin, Drosocin show differential expression in response to ecdysone. We show that early gene Broad complex (BR-C) could be regulating the IMD pathway by activating Relish and physically interacting with it to activate AMPs expression. BR-C depletion from Malpighian tubules renders the flies susceptible to infection. We also show that in MTs ecdysone signaling is transduced by EcR-B1 and B2. In the absence of ecdysone signaling the IMD pathway associated genes are down regulated and activation and translocation of transcription factor Relish is also affected. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The structure and morphology of the samples have been studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The physical and optical properties of the samples have been measured and compared. A broad intense infrared emission centered at 850 nm due to 116 1G4 transition along with sharp green emission centerd at 513 nm due to 3P0 -3H4 transition are observed on excitation with 976 nm laser. The emission intensity of Pr + is optimized with concentration and it is maximum at 0.08 mol%. The annealed samples are found to be more crystalline and emit larger photoluminescence due to removal of quenching centers. The power dependent study of green upconversion emission indicates the involvement of two photons. The phosphor in La(OH)3 phase is more stable though the photoluminescence emission is slightly weak. La(OH)3 is less toxic compared to La203 and is biocompatible. It generates more heat and can be used in biothermal treatment. 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"[Yadav, R. S.; Verma, R.

To investigate if signaling by Cd-induced H2O2 or SA, collide or integrate, rice cv. HUR3022, grown for 3, 7 and 10 day under 50 A mu M Cd/SA alone or in combination were studied. Dynamic distribution of Cd2+ and SA, cell viability, time-dependent changes in H2O2 levels, free proline, chlorophyll, ascorbate and glutathione pools and altered antioxidant enzymes in roots/shoots of rice were observed. Exogenous SA decelerated cell-death in Cd-stressed rice playing a positive role in protection against injury. Cd led to elevated activities of superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, guaiacol peroxidase and phenylalanine ammonia lyase and lowered catalase and glutathione reductase activities in roots and shoots of rice seedlings. By contrast, SA + Cd2+ reversed the trend of enzyme activities, levels of non-enzymatic antioxidants and GSH in roots/shoots suggesting alleviation of Cd-induced oxidative damage in rice. Suppression of Cd-uptake in presence of SA suggest an epistatic effect of SA-signal over Cd-induced ROS-signal in rice roots. No additive effects of SA or H2O2 signals were noted in Cd-stressed rice. Results indicate integration of different signals and SA-enhanced Cd2+ tolerance due to SA-regulated Cd2+ uptake as well as the SA-elevated enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant pool in rice. Role of salicylic acid in rice plants grown under Cd-contaminated soil was studied. Cd-induced H2O2 or SA, signals both collide and/or integrate.

The method applies fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm on the solvation data for vapor-polymer sorptive interactions. The data set consists of equilibrium partition coefficients for target vapors in a large set of prospective polymers. The FCM algorithm sorts out polymers of similar characteristics into c fuzzy clusters, and subset of polymers representing the centers of these clusters are selected for making the sensor array. The partition coefficient data are calculated by using Abraham's linear-solvation-energy relationship (LSER), and the clustering algorithm considers the polymers as objects and the vapors as observables. The value of c >= 2 is determined by repeated clustering with c incremented by 1 until a common subset of polymers emerges that appears in every successive FCM implementation. The method is validated by simulation of SAW sensor arrays for detection of freshness and spoilage marker volatiles in headspace of milk and fish. The identification and concentration estimation are done by applying the radial basis function neural network on simulation data. It is suggested that the present FCM method of polymer selection prior to sensor fabrication could be helpful in optimizing performance and reducing cost of SAW electronic noses for various applications.

Since both herbicides respond overlapped oxidation peaks and only glyphosate is prone to nitrosation, n-nitroso glyphosate and glufosinate were used as templates for obtaining the well-resolved quantitative differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetric peaks on the proposed sensor. Toward sensor fabrication, a nano-structured polymer film was first grown directly on the electrode via initial immobilization of gold nanoparticles at its surface. This was followed by linking of monomeric (N-methacryloyl-L-cysteine) molecules through S-Au bonds. Subsequently, these molecules were subjected to free radical polymerization, in the presence of templates, cross linker, initiator, and multiwalled carbon nanotubes as pre-polymer mixture. The modified sensor observed wide linear ranges (3.98-176.23 ng mL(-1) and 0.54-3.96 ng mL(-1)) of simultaneous analysis with detection limits as low as 0.35 and 0.19 ng mL(-1) (S/N=3) for glyphosate and glufosinate, respectively, in aqueous samples.

Myb complex functions to activate or repress transcription in a site-specific manner; however, the detailed mechanism is yet to be clearly understood. Members of the Drosophila melanogaster Myb-MuvB/dREAM complex have been known to regulate expression of a wide range of genes including those involved in regulating apoptosis. E2F and its corepressor RBF also belong to this complex and together they regulate expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression, apoptosis, differentiation, and development. In the present study, we examined whether the depletion of dlin52 in developing photoreceptor neurons results in enhanced apoptosis and disorganisation of the ommatidia. Strikingly, we found that dLin52 is essential for transcriptional repression of the pro-apoptotic gene, hid; decrease in dlin52 levels led to dramatic induction of hid and apoptosis in eye-antennal discs. Reduction of Rpd3 (HDAC1), another member of the dREAM complex, also led to marginal upregulation of Hid. In addition, we also demonstrated that an optimum level of dLin52 is needed for dE2F1/2 activity on the hid promoter. dlin52 cooperates with dRBF and dE2F1/2 for recruitment of repressor complex on the hid promoter. Preliminary data indicate that Rpd3/HDAC1 also contributes to hid repression. Based on the findings, we conclude that dLin52 functions as a co-factor and modulates activity of members of dMyb/dREAM complex at hid promoter, thus regulating apoptosis by repressing this pro-apoptotic gene in the developing Drosophila eye.

In the first study, male mice (n = 6) of three age groups (3-week-old sexually immature, 9-week-old sexually mature and 1.5-year-old) were assayed for plasma testosterone and level of NO in the plasma and testis. The immunoreactivity of 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3-beta-HSD) and androgen receptors (ARs) was also detected in testis and epididymis, respectively. In the second study, the reproductive state of mice was altered by injecting precursors of serotonin 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) and dopamine l-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) daily for 13 days. In one subgroup, mice received their daily injections 8 h apart and in another subgroup 12 h apart. A third subgroup of control mice received two daily injections of normal saline. After the completion of the experiment, the mentioned parameters were measured. The results showed a significant increase in levels of NO and a lowering of the immune reactivity of 3-beta-HSD and AR, in both leydig cells and the epididymis in the sexually immature, old-age mice as well as in the mice that received 5-HTP and l-DOPA in the 8-h temporal relation, whereas opposite effects were observed in the sexually mature mice as well as in the mice that received 5-HTP and l-DOPA in the 12-h temporal relation. These findings led us to conclude that an inverse correlation exists between testicular steroidogenic activity and NO activity of laboratory mice under control and experimentally modulated gonadal conditions.","[Singh, Vineet Prakash; Chaturvedi, Chandra Mohini] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Chaturvedi, CM (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",cmcbhu@gmail.com,,,"Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, New Delhi, India [37/(1284)/07/EMR-II]","Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, New Delhi, India(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India)","This work was funded by a research Grant (37/(1284)/07/EMR-II) to CMC from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, New Delhi, India.

Biochemical characterization, using specific substrates and inhibitors, indicated that measured esterase activity in skin mucus was mainly owing to ChEs. Significant difference in the proportion of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase activities was observed in skin mucus of three carps. Enzyme kinetic analysis, using the substrate acetylthiocholine iodide revealed significantly high V-max value in C. catla compared to that in L. rohita and C. mrigala. In contrast, V-max value using the substrate butyrylthiocholine iodide was significantly high in C. mrigala than in L. rohita and C. catla. In vitro treatment of skin mucus of three carps, with the organophosphorus insecticide Nuvan (R), showed strong inhibition of ChE activities. In vivo experiments conducted using C. mrigala and exposing the fish to the sublethal test concentrations (5 and 15 mg/L) of the insecticide also revealed significant inhibition of ChE activity in mucus. In C. mrigala, exposed to the sublethal test concentrations of the insecticide for 4 days and then kept for recovery for 16 days, mucus ChE activity recovered to the control level. Thus, ChE activity in skin mucus could be considered a good biomarker of the organophosphorus insecticide exposure to fish and a useful tool in monitoring environmental toxicity.

Maize (Zea mays L.), a C4 plant is the third most important staple crop at global level with a great deal of economic importance. The present study was conducted to evaluate the performance of two maize cultivars [HQPM1: quality protein maize (QPM)] and [DHM117: nonquality protein maize (NQPM)] to variable O-3 doses. Experimental setup included filtered chambers, nonfiltered chambers (NFC), and two elevated doses of O-3 viz. NFC+15 ppb O-3 (NFC+15) and NFC+30 ppb O-3 (NFC+30). During initial growth period, both QPM and NQPM plants showed hormetic effect that is beneficial due to exposure of low doses of a toxicant (NFC and NFC+15 ppb O-3), but at later stages, growth attributes were negatively affected by O-3. Growth indices showed the variable pattern of photosynthate translocation under O-3 stress. Foliar injury in the form of interveinal chlorosis and reddening of leaves due to increased production of anthocyanin pigments was observed at higher concentrations of O-3. One-dimensional gel electrophoresis of leaves taken from NFC+30 showed reductions of major photosynthetic proteins, and differential response was observed between the two test cultivars. Decline in the number of male flowers at elevated O-3 doses suggested damaging effect of O-3 on reproductive structures which might be a cause of productivity losses. Variable carbon allocation pattern particularly to husk leaves, foliar injury, and damage of photosynthetic proteins led to significant reductions in economic yield at higher O-3 doses. PCA showed that both the cultivars responded more or less similarly to O-3 stress in their respective groupings of growth and yield parameters, but magnitude of their response was variable. It is further supported by difference in the significance of correlations between variables of yield and AOT40. Cultivar response reflects that QPM performed better than NQPM against elevated O-3.","[Singh, Aditya Abha; Agrawal, S.

In the present investigation, the interactive effects of two important abiotic stresses, i.e., water deficit and Al toxicity, were examined in the seedlings of two rice (Oryza sativa L.) cvs. Malviya-36 (water deficit/Al sensitive) and Vandana (water deficit/Al tolerant). When 15 days grown seedlings were exposed to water deficit (created with 15 % polyethylene glycol 6000) or Al (1 mM AlCl3) treatment or both the treatments together for 48 h, the lengths of root/shoot, relative water content, and chlorophyll greatly declined in the seedlings of the sensitive cultivar, whereas in the tolerant seedlings, either little or insignificant decline in these parameters was observed due to the treatments. Seedlings subjected to water deficit or Al treatment alone or in combination showed increased intensity of the isoenzyme activity bands of superoxide dismutase (SOD), guaiacol peroxidase (GPX), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) in in-gel activity staining studies. Water deficit caused decrease in intensity of catalase (CAT) activity bands; however, when seedlings were exposed to AlCl3 alone or in combination with water deficit, the intensity of the CAT isoforms increased in both the rice cultivars. The level of expression of the activity bands of SOD, CAT, GPX, and APX was always higher in the seedlings of tolerant cv. Vandana compared to the sensitive cv.

Analysis of a kinetic scheme involving competing reactions of OH center dot with different species in a Fe2+ containing system leads to a primary yield of 11 mol (mol electron)(-1) each for OH center dot and H-center dot each in the liquid phase reaction zone of anodic CGDE. This value agrees well with the yields reported in previous studies involving H. and other OW scavengers and thus may be accepted as a reliable measure of the primary radical yield of anodic CGDE.

Although, myelopoiesis also depends on de novo fatty acid synthesis, the effect of orlistat on differentiation of macrophages, which play a central role in host's antitumor defence, remains unexplored in a tumor-bearing host. Therefore, the present investigation was undertaken to examine the effect of orlistat administration on macrophage differentiation in a T cell lymphoma bearing host. Administration of orlistat (240 mg/kg/day/mice) to tumor-bearing mice resulted in a decline of tumor load accompanied by an augmentation of bone marrow cellularity and survival of bone marrow cells (BMC). The expression of apoptosis regulatory caspase-3, Bax and Bcl2 was modulated in the BMC of orlistat-administered tumor-bearing mice. Orlistat administration also resulted in an increase in serum level of IFN-gamma along with decreased TGF-beta and IL-10. BMC of orlistat-administered tumor-bearing mice showed augmented differentiation into macrophages accompanied by enhanced expression of macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and its receptor (M-CSFR). The macrophages differentiated from BMC of orlistat-administered mice showed characteristic features of M-1 macrophage phenotype confirmed by expression of CD11c, TLR-2, generation of reactive oxygen species, phagocytosis, tumor cell cytotoxicity, production of IL-1, TNF-alpha and nitric oxide. These novel findings indicate that orlistat could be useful to support myelopoesis in a tumor-bearing host.","[Kant, Shiva; Kumar, Ajay; Singh, Sukh Mahendra] Banaras Hindu Univ, Sch Biotechnol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Singh, SM (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Sch Biotechnol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",sukhmahendrasingh@yahoo.com,"Kumar, Ajay/AER-0947-2022; kant, shiva/AAC-5429-2020","Kumar, Ajay/0000-0002-6635-0586","DBT; UGC University; DST-PURSE program, Government of India, New Delhi; Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) New Delhi [DBT-JRF/2010-11/79, 09/013(0329)/2010-EMR-I]","DBT(Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India); UGC University; DST-PURSE program, Government of India, New Delhi; Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) New Delhi(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India)","The financial support to the School of Biotechnology from DBT, UGC University with potential for excellence program and the DST-PURSE program, Government of India, New Delhi is acknowledged.

We report that 5-HTP (50mg/kg) entrains the free-running rhythm of Mus terricolor to 24h, when presented once in 24h at zeitgeber time (ZT) 6, corresponding to its previously known circadian time (CT) of maximum advance in complete darkness (CT 6), on the last pre-intervention day. This entrainment is accompanied by shortening of the period and visible after withdrawal of injections. After-effects may persist for a few days. The mechanistic explanation is currently unknown, but this probably occurs through serotonergic phase and period modifications. 5-HTP is thus potentially useful as a chronobiotic in circadian rhythm disorders.","[Basu, Priyoneel; Singaravel, Muniyandi] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Chronobiol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Singaravel, M (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Chronobiol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",m_singaravel@yahoo.com,"Basu, Priyoneel/GNH-3077-2022",,Banaras Hindu University [F(A)1-14(G)/3449]; UGC [39-572/2010 (SR)]; CSIR-UGC,"Banaras Hindu University; UGC(University Grants Commission, India); CSIR-UGC(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - IndiaUniversity Grants Commission, India)","Financial aid by Banaras Hindu University vide grant No. F(A)1-14(G)/3449, Research grant through UGC Major Research Project (No. 39-572/2010 (SR), help with animal handling by Mr Punit Kumar and CSIR-UGC Senior Research Fellowship to PB are thankfully acknowledged.",,25,0,0,0,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0929-1016,1744-4179,,BIOL RHYTHM RES,Biol.

To date, the immune adjustments being a result of photoperiodic exposures for any nocturnal seasonally breeding rodent have not been systematically examined. Therefore, we evaluated the humoral and cell mediated immune responses of photoperiodically entrained male golden hamsters. Short day induced melatonin increased the immune parameters such as spleen mass, total leukocyte (TLC) and lymphocyte count (LC), proliferation of splenocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) along with serum IL-2 and anti-Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) IgG production when compared with long day experienced hamsters. Short term melatonin treatment (for two weeks) to long day hamsters enhanced to some extent the proliferation of splenocytes, PBMC and TLC/LC. We also localized the melatonin membrane receptor MT1 in spleen and BMMNCs that strongly supported our western blot analysis for the expression of MT1 in spleen suggesting that different photoperiodically induced circulatory melatonin is responsible for the immunomodulation. Therefore, photoperiod can influence the peripheral melatonin level to improve immune responses of hamsters according to season for better survival. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Upon UV-B irradiation, both strains showed a 2-5-fold increase in antioxidative enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and peroxidase (POD), as compared to non-irradiated control cultures. These enzymes scavenge damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated by UV-B radiation inside the cells. In addition, these organisms also synthesize mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) which are able to carry out UV-screening and/at the same time as UV-quenching. The identification and characterization of three types of MAAs from both Anabaena species were performed using absorption spectroscopy, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), electro spray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Shinorine was found to be the most common MM in both Anabaena species while porphyra-334 and mycosporine-glycine were present only in A. doliolum. The results of the present investigation clearly demonstrate that both enzymatic and non-enzymatic defense mechanisms are being employed by A. doliolum and Anabaena strain L31 to counteract the damaging effects of UV-B radiation.

PCC7120 showing enhanced expression under sodium arsenate (Na2HAsO4) stress belongs to the thioredoxin superfamily with structural similarity to bacterial arsenate reductase. The All0195 protein demonstrated C-X-TC-X-K, NTSG-X-2-YR, and D-X-2-L-X-KRP as functional motifs that show similarity to seven known bacterial arsenate reductase family protein homologs with Cys, Arg, and Pro as conserved residues. In view of physicochemical properties, such as aliphatic index, ratio of Glu + Lys to Gln + His, and secondary structure, it was evident that All0195 was also a thermostable protein. The predicted three-dimensional structure on molecular docking with arsenate oxyanion () revealed its interaction with conserved Cys residue as also known for other bacterial arsenate reductase. In silico derived properties were experimentally attested by cloning and heterologous expression of all0195. Furthermore, this protein functionally complemented the arsenate reductase-deficient sodium arsenate-hypersensitive phenotype of Escherichia coli strainWC3110 (Delta arsC) and depicted arsenate reductase activity on purification. In view of the above properties, All0195 appears to be a new arsenate reductase involved in arsenic detoxification in Anabaena sp. PCC7120.","[Pandey, Sarita; Shrivastava, A. K.; Singh, P.

The mechanisms of NRAMP1 regulation are largely unknown in leishmanial infections. In the present study, we identified a secretory Leishmania donovani peroxidase (Prx) that showed peroxidoxin like peroxidase activity and significantly reduced H2O2, O-2(-) and NO levels in LPS activated macrophages. Further, we also observed down regulated Nramp1 expression and concomitantly declined labile iron pool in activated macrophages treated with identified peroxidase. Prx also decreased levels of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and IL-12 in LPS activated macrophages.

Methods: All adult patients of laboratory-proven malaria with acute kidney injury (AKI) admitted during the period of May 2010 to June 2011 were included. Patient characteristics, physical examination findings, and laboratory parameters were recorded. Patient outcome was assessed in terms of peak serum creatinine level, duration of hospital stay, need for dialysis, and in-hospital mortality rate. Surviving patients were followed up for 3 months to determine progression to chronic kidney disease. Results: This study enrolled 101 patients of malarial AKI. Mean age was 33.70 +/- 15.39 years. Oliguric AKI was observed in 44.6% cases. Mean duration of hospital stay was 8.75 +/- 7.60 days. Renal replacement therapy was required in 36.6% patients. Ten (9.9%) patients succumbed to illness during hospital stay. Majority of deaths occurred shortly after admission. Mortality risk was significantly associated with raised LDH (p = 0.019), lower hemoglobin level (p = 0.015), raised aspartate transaminases (p<0.001), and elevated alanine transaminases (p = 0.016). Cerebral malaria was an important determinant of mortality (p = 0.002). Renal parameters, including severity of renal dysfunction and need for dialysis, were not associated with mortality risk. Among 91 survivors, 79 patients completed a 3-month follow-up and all of them had normalization of renal function. Conclusion: We observed 9.9% in-hospital mortality rate in the study cohort. Cerebral malaria was an important risk factor for mortality in malarial AKI patients. Severity of renal dysfunction did not correlate with the mortality risk in our study.","[Shukla, Vishnu Shanker] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Med, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Singh, Rana Gopal; Rathore, Surendra Singh] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Nephrol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Usha] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Pathol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Rathore, SS (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Nephrol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",surensrathore@yahoo.co.in,,"Singh, Rana Gopal/0000-0002-1195-8738",,,,,28,7,9,1,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0886-022X,1525-6049,,RENAL FAILURE,Ren.

The microbes were applied as seed treatment in different combinations in two sets and the pathogen was inoculated in one of the sets after 3weeks of sowing. A comparative study was conducted on the effect of the microbial combinations on host antioxidant mechanisms between the two sets. In pathogen challenged plants host defence responses included higher accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at petiolar and interveinal regions of leaf and high activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR) and guaiacol peroxidase (GPx) compared to unchallenged plants. The antioxidant enzyme activities increased 1.8-3.3 and 1.9-3.1 folds at 48 and 72h, respectively, in the triple microbe treated challenged plants compared to unchallenged ones. Although, ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity was significantly low, ascorbic acid (AA) and chitinase accumulation was high in the pathogen challenged plants. Antioxidant flavonols associated with host defence namely myricetin, quercetin and kaempferol also accumulated in high amounts in pathogen challenged plants. Among the microbial treatments, the triple microbe combination induced the highest response in all parameters as compared to dual or single application of the same microbes. The triple microbe consortium modulated the chickpea antioxidant mechanisms more efficiently and modulation of oxidative stress was directly correlated with lower plant mortality, thus demonstrating the synergistic behaviour of the microbes in protecting chickpea from the pathogen.","[Singh, A.; Jain, A.; Upadhyay, R.

The present study was conducted to determine if Metronidazole is really making a difference in the healing of DFU. Methods. Deep tissue samples from the wound area of 61 diabetic foot patients were tested for anaerobic bacterial infection (Peptostreptococcus productus, Bacteroides, and Clostridium) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR-positive patients were randomized into 2 groups: Metronidazole and non-Metronidazole. Antibiotics for the control of infection were given in both groups as per clinical condition of patients. Treatment outcome was assessed by complete healing of the wound. Results. Out of 61 patients, PCR detected evidence of anaerobic infection in 32 (52%), while culture methods detected only 5 (8%) (Clostridium spp.), hence emphasizing the significance of the PCR technique over culture methods in detection of microbes. In this study, Clostridium was found with maximum prevalence of n (75%), followed by Bacteroides with n (53.1%), and Peptostreptococcus productus with n (40.6 %). Across all Wagner Ulcer Classification grades, Clostridium was the most prevalent anaerobe, and significantly associated with wound age and total leukocyte count. No difference was noted in wound healing in both groups at the end of 16 weeks. Conclusions. The authors propose that it is not mandatory to supplement Metronidazole in antibiotic regime for treatment of DFU.","[Aherrao, Nitin; Dwivedi, Awanindra; Singh, Stoya Kumar] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Endocrinol & Metab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Shabi, Shailesb K.; Kumar, Ashok] Banaras Hindu Univ, Sch Biotechnol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Gupta, Sanjeev] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Gen Surg, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Singh, SK (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Endocrinol & Metab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",sksirgh.endocrinebhu@gmail.com,,"Gupta, Sanjeev/0000-0002-2014-5333; Shahi, Shailesh/0000-0002-8506-7655",,,,,10,6,6,1,13,H M P COMMUNICATIONS,MALVERN,"83 GENERAL WARREN BLVD, STE 100, MALVERN, PA 19355 USA",1044-7946,1943-2704,,WOUNDS,Wounds-Compend.

The accurate vibrational assignment of all vibrational bands of creatinine has been done on the basis of the calculated vibrational spectra and the potential energy distribution. The calculated Raman spectra of hydrogen bonded tetramer cluster matches nicely with the experimentally observed spectra confirming four molecules in unit cell as reported by crystallographic data. In addition signature of dimer, which is just half of the tetramer, has also been observed. The bands associated with -CH3, -CH2, nu(C=O), nu(C=N) and nu(C-H) have been given more focus to see the behavior of hydrogen bond network with temperature. The analysis of these bands reveals that a gradual change (increase/decrease) in linewidth and peak position occurs with temperature as a consequence of the anharmonic coupling of internal modes with phonon mode and intermolecular interaction. The behavior of hydrogen bond network on cooling has been explained in terms of contraction of unit cell. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Vikram, K.; Mishra, Shivangi; Srivastava, S.

Exogenous MnCl2 treatment to excised rice leaves for 24 and 48 h resulted in increased production of H2O2 and lipid peroxides, decline in the levels of antioxidants, glutathione and ascorbic acid, and increased activities of antioxidative enzymes, superoxide dismutase, guaiacol peroxidase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, dehydroascorbate reductase, and glutathione reductase. Treatment of rice leaves with 100 mu M sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a NO donor, was effective in reducing Mn-induced increased levels of H2O2, lipid peroxides and increased activities of antioxidative enzymes. The levels of reduced ascorbate and glutathione were considerably recovered due to SNP treatment. The effect of SNP was reversed by the addition of NO scavenger, 2-(4-carboxy-2-phenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-imidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (c-PTIO) suggesting that ameliorating effect of SNP is due to release of NO. The results indicate that MnCl2 induces oxidative stress in excised rice leaves, lowers the levels of reduced ascorbate and glutathione, and elevates activities of the key antioxidative enzymes. NO appears to provide a protection to the rice leaves against Mn-induced oxidative stress and that exogenous NO application could be advantageous in combating the deleterious effects of Mn-toxicity in rice plants.","[Srivastava, Sarita; Dubey, R.

Study of inter-specific variation in the FTs of plants aids in classifying species into plant functional types (PFTs) and provides insights into fundamental patterns and trade-offs in plant form and functioning and the effect of changing species composition on ecosystem functions. Specifically, this paper focuses on those FTs that make a species successful in the dry tropical environment. Following a brief overview, we discuss plant FTs that may be particularly relevant to tropical deciduous forests (TDFs). We consider the traits under the following categories: leaf traits, stem and root traits, reproductive traits, and traits particularly relevant to water availability. We compile quantitative information on functional traits of dry tropical forest species. We also discuss trait-based grouping of plants into PFTs. We recognize that there is incomplete knowledge about many FTs and their effects on TDFs and point out the need for further research on PFTs of TDF species, which can enable prediction of the dynamics of these forests in the face of disturbance and global climate change. Correlations between structural and ecophysiological traits and ecosystem functioning should also be established which could make it possible to generate predictions of changes in ecosystem services from changes in functional composition.","[Chaturvedi, R.

In order to determine the possibility of clonality in the bacteria and to track the resistance markers for a better understanding of the epidemiology of drug resistance. A total of 500 strains, 100 each from clinical, water, animal, plant and soil sources were subjected to antibiogram analysis by disc diffusion method. Seventy-five randomly selected strains, 15 each of the five sources were subjected to ERIC-PCR analysis. Clinical isolates were more resistant to combinations of very high numbers of drugs as compared to isolates from other sources. Weak clonality was observed in P. aeruginosa by ERIC-PCR method with 80% of the clinical strains belonging to only 3 clones. It could be concluded that it is the drug selection pressure in clinical environment that is causing the accumulation of drug resistance against many antimicrobials. Furthermore, P. aeruginosa does have clonal expansion.

Qualitative studies were carried out by using electrophoretic technique sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Mainly four protein fractions i.e. albumin, globulin, prolamin and glutelin were obtained. Protein isolates were prepared by (a) extraction at different alkaline pH (9, 10, 11 and 12) and precipitation at pH 5 and (b) extraction at pH 9 and precipitation at different pH (4, 5, 6 and 7). The composition of isolates, prepared by method (a), depended on extraction pH. The isolate extracted at pH 8 was mainly composed of albumin and globulin, whereas at pH 9, 10 and 11 showed the presence of prolamin and glutelin. Electrophoretic pattern of different isolates had five major bands with molecular weight of 30, 45, 72, 84 and 90 kDt respectively. The increase of the extraction pH led to the increase in protein yield. With method (b) isolates obtained were variable in composition. At pH 7 albumin and prolamine were present, whereas at pH 4, 5 and 6 all 4 protein fractions were precipitated. According to the quantitative estimation of the albumin, globulin, prolamin and glutelin in the seed flour the contents were 26.4, 25, 5.81 and 42.7%, respectively. The results suggest that composition of protein isolates could be controlled by different extraction and precipitation pH.","[Srivastava, Reema; Roy, Bijoy K.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Adv Study Bot, Lab Cytogenet, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Srivastava, R (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Adv Study Bot, Lab Cytogenet, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",reemasri.bhu@gmail.com,"Srivastava, Reema/AAT-9923-2020","Srivastava, Reema/0000-0002-7404-6672","University Grant Commission, New Delhi, India","University Grant Commission, New Delhi, India(University Grants Commission, India)","This research was supported by University Grant Commission, New Delhi, India as research fellowship.

All these isolates showed nitrogenase activity in the range of 0.23 to 1.72 mu mol C2H4 mg(-1) protein h(-1). Further analysis showed that 84 (73.68%) isolates were Indole-3- acetic acid (IAA) producer; the value of IAA production ranged from 10.1 to 353.0 mu g IAA mg(-1) protein. IAA production occurred solely in the medium supplemented with tryptophan. P solubilization activity was observed in 28 (24.56%) isolates, the activity being in the range of 38.50 to 321.0 P released mu g mg(-1) protein. 45 (39.46%) isolates were capable of producing siderophore, the range of production being 4.50 to 223.26 mu g mg(-1) protein. Analysis of molecular diversity was made by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) and denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), which exhibited distinct differences among all the isolates. Of the 114 isolates, twenty one (21) isolates showed multiple plant growth promoting traits and were potent in terms of PGP activities. These isolates were identified on the basis of 16S rDNA sequencing and belonged to the genera Pantoea, Bacillus, Microbacterium, Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas, Ancylobacter, Enterobacter, Advenella, gamma-proteobacterium strain VA3S1, Rhizobium and Agrobacterium.

Combinations of NPK were recommended, 1.5 times NPK, 1.5 times N and 1.5 times K. sUV-B radiation negatively affected the growth and economic yield with more reductions at 1.5 times recommended NPK, N and K compared to recommended NPK. Total biomass remained unaffected in plants at recommended NPK under sUV-B radiation. At 1.5 times NPK and N more partitioning of biomass to shoot led to reduction in root shoot ratio and consequently yield under sUV-B. Nutrients in edible part declined maximally at 1.5 times recommended K under sUV-B. The study suggests that higher than recommended NPK makes radish plants more sensitive to sUV-B in terms of yield by allocating less photosynthates towards roots compared to shoots.

It has been found that the rate of change of the space charge field with the normalized dc field decreases with the increasing intensity ratio for different values of the normalized diffusion field It has also been found that the externally applied dc electric field has appreciable effect only when it is larger than the diffusion field (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

DR-92 and tolerant rice cv. Bh-1 grown in North East region of India were studied in sand cultures. Increasing levels of 0-500 mu M Cd2+ alone and/or heat stress showed increased activities of superoxide dismutase, guaiacol peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase enzymes which were associated with induced oxidative stress and altered enzyme activities. The values for SOD and POD activities were always more in cv. DR-92 whereas CAT and GR activities were higher in cv. Bh-1 in roots and shoots under Cd2+ or heat stress alone in sensitive cv. DR-92. Upon imposition of a combination of Cd2+ + heat the activities of SOD and POD decreased significantly in root/shoot of both the sensitive and tolerant rice varieties. A nine fold increase in GR activity under combination of heat + 100 mu M Cd2+ stress in shoots of cv. Bh-1 at day 15 was noted when compared to controls. The dual stress combination of Cd2+ + heat did not alter catalase activity in vivo in both the rice varieties. Results suggest a time-specific and varietal distribution of the antioxidant enzymes in rice plants subjected to Cd2+ and/or heat stress. Tolerant cv. Bh-1 has better survival to combined stressors like Cd2+ and heat than sensitive rice cv. DR-92 and heat stress when given in combination with Cd2+ toxicity seem to mitigate the effect of Cd2+ stress alone in rice. The study indicates individual Cd2+ toxicity and heat stress and a combination of the two stresses to have separate implications on antioxidative defense mechanism in rice plants. Among enzymes of the defense apparatus ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase appear to serve as an important component for better survival of rice plants under combination of Cd2+ + heat stress.","[Shah, Kavita] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Biochem Bioinformat Res Lab, Mahila Mahavidyalaya, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Nahakpam, Sareeta] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Biochem, Fac Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Shah, K (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Biochem Bioinformat Res Lab, Mahila Mahavidyalaya, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",nichsareeta@gmail.com; kavitashah@bhu.ac.in,"Shah, Kavita/E-8926-2012","SHAH, KAVITA/0000-0003-0464-6100","Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India, New Delhi [SR/FT/L-75/2003]","Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India, New Delhi(Department of Science & Technology (India))","Financial support for the work by Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India, New Delhi in the form of a project (SR/FT/L-75/2003) is gratefully acknowledged.

Only few vibrational bands of paraldehyde show a significant change in their peak position in going from neat prldh to the complexes. One peculiar feature in this study is that the solvent band which occurs at similar to 1034cm(-1) shows significant red shift of > 4 cm(-1) at higher mole fractions of prldh. This red shift is caused due to the hydrogen bonding between the O atom of the prldh ring and H atom of the methanol molecules. The Raman band at similar to 1097 cm(-1) band shows a blue shift of similar to 5 cm(-1) upon dilution and its linewidth also shows an increase of similar to 5 cm(-1) in going from neat prldh to extreme dilution. The line broadening upon dilution clearly indicates that the diffusion mechanism plays a dominant role in the dephasing of this vibrational mode. Density functional theoretic (DFT) calculations were performed employing B3LYP functional and high level basis set, 6-311++G(d,p) to obtain the ground state geometry of neat prldh and its hydrogen bonded complexes with methanol in gas phase. Basis set superimpose error (BSSE) correction was also introduced using the counterpoise method. In order to realize a condition quite close to the experiment, the polarizable continuum model (PCM, specific plus bulk solvation) calculations were also performed. For a detailed vibrational assignment of the normal modes, potential energy distribution (PED) calculation was also performed.","[Singh, Shweta; Singh, Dheeraj K.; Srivastava, Sunil K.; Asthana, Birendra P.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Phys, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Asthana, BP (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Phys, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",bpasthana@rediffmail.com,,"Singh, Dheeraj/0000-0001-8370-9549","Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; DST-India; UGC; Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), India","Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); DST-India(Department of Science & Technology (India)); UGC(University Grants Commission, India); Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), India(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India)","The authors would like to thank Prof. Wolfgang Kiefer and Prof. Sebastian Schlucker for providing access to their laboratory facilities to one of us (DKS) to make the polarized Raman measurements.

Padmini (linseed), under field conditions in open-top chambers, to evaluate the interactive effects of supplemental ultraviolet-B (sUV-B; ambient +7.2 kJ center dot m-2 center dot d-1) and ozone (O-3; ambient +10 ppb). Treatment of plants with sUV-B and O-3, individually or in combination, caused several changes in enzymatic and non-enzymatic components of the antioxidant defence system. Photo-oxidative damage caused by sUV-B and O-3, included lipid peroxidation, changed protein profiles and caused DNA strand breakage. One-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that proteins of 222.24 and 50.5 kDa are specific and appear after sUV-B and O-3 exposure, and could be used as indicator proteins. Effects of sUV-B and O-3 given separately are more detrimental as compared to combined treatment. Mutational and structural alterations in linseed DNA after these stresses were also examined using RAPD with ten different primers. The study concluded that both stresses, i.e. sUV-B and O-3, are phytotoxic, causing significant changes in metabolites, antioxidants, the leaf proteome and the genome of linseed, but their interactive effect was always less than additive.","[Tripathi, R.; Sarkar, A.; Agrawal, S.

It is found that the anionic radical of the EDT-DTO molecule is unstable.

It is found that the most of the vibrational characteristics of the radicals are similar to their corresponding neutral molecules, however, for some of the modes significant changes are noticed. As a result of anionic radicalization of EDT-DTT, the IR intensity and Raman activity increase and Raman band becomes polarized for both the CH2 twisting modes. Drastic enhancements in the Raman activity and reduced IR intensity are noticed for the C=S/O stretching mode in going from neutral molecules to their radical ions consistent with charge separation along this bond.

Sera and urine samples from 455 subjects-150 confirmed visceral leishmaniasis cases, 160 endemic controls, 100 non-endemic controls, and 45 other febrile diseases-were included in the study. The sensitivity of the KAtex, DAT, and rK39 strip test was 87% [95% confidence interval (CI) 80-96], 93.3% (95% CI 88-100), and 98% (95% CI 93-100) respectively. The specificity of these tests was 98% (95% CI 93-100), 93% (95% CI 87-100), and 89% (95% CI 82-97) for the KAtex, DAT, and rK39 strip test respectively. Fifty cases were followed up and subjected to the KAtex, DAT, and rK39 strip test after 30 days of successful treatment. The DAT and rK39 strip test showed positive results in all the 50 cases whereas the KAtex showed no positive reaction in any case. Based on the results, it is concluded that the sensitivity and specificity of the DAT and rK39 strip test are comparable but the greater convenience of use of the strip test makes it a better tool for the diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis in the peripheral areas of endemic regions whereas the sensitivity of the KAtex needs to be improved to promote its use as a first-line diagnostic test in the field-setting. It may be used for the prognosis of the disease as antigen becomes undetectable in urine after 30 days of the completion of the treatment. Alternatively, it can be used as an adjunct with rK39 for sero-epidemiological surveys.","[Singh, Dharmendra P.; Goyal, Rahul K.; Singh, Rahul K.; Mohapatra, Tribhuban M.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Microbiol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Sundar, S.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Med, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Mohapatra, TM (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Microbiol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",tmmohapatra2000@yahoo.com,"Singh, Rahul Kunwar/ABA-3758-2020","Singh, Rahul Kunwar/0000-0003-3630-5706",,,,,30,24,24,0,4,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1606-0997,2072-1315,,J HEALTH POPUL NUTR,J.

The immune system can be influenced by a variety of Signals and one of them is photic stimulus. Light may regulate the immunity through the neuroendocrine system leading to the most recent branch of research the Photoimmunomodulation. Mammals perceive visible light (400-700 nm) through some specialized photoreceptors located in retina like retinal ganglion cells (RGC). This photic signal is then delivered to the visual cortex from there to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamic region. Melatonin - one of the universally accepted chronobiotic molecule secreted by the pineal gland is now emerging as one of the most effective immunostimulatory compound in rodents and as oncostatic molecule at least in human. Its synthesis decreases with light activation along with norepinephrine and acetylcholine. The changes in level of melatonin may lead to alterations (stimulatory/inhibitory) in immune system. The evidences for the presence of melatonin receptor subtypes on lymphoid tissues heralded the research area about mechanism of action for melatonin. Further, melatonin receptor subtypes-MT1 and MT2 was noted on pars tuberalis, SCN and on lymphatic tissues suggesting a direct action of melatonin in modulation of immunity by photoperiod as well. The nuclear receptors (ROR, RZR etc.) of melatonin are known for its free radical scavenging actions and might be indirectly controlling the immune function.

Herbal plants have been characterized using FTIR spectroscopy. Characteristic peaks (strong and weak) have been marked for each herbal sample in the fingerprint region (400-2000 cm(-1)). The ratio of the areas of any two marked characteristic peaks was found to be nearly consistent for the same plant from different regions, and thus the present idea suggests an additional discrimination method for herbal medicines. PCA clusters herbal medicines into different groups, clearly showing that this method can adequately discriminate different herbal medicines using FTIR data.

Tropical countries including India are at greater risk due to their meteorological conditions (high solar radiation and temperature) being conducive to the formation of O-3. The most effective anti-ozonant chemical is N-[2-(2-oxo-1-imidazolidinyl) ethyl]-N-phenylurea or ethylene diurea (EDU). Due to its specific characteristics, EDU has been used in the field as a phytomonitoring agent to assess crop losses due to O-3. Field experiments were conducted on five local cultivars of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv HUW234, HUW468, HUW510, PBW343, and Sonalika) grown under natural field conditions in a suburban area of Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India during December 2006 to March 2007 to determine the impact of O-3 on their growth and yield characteristics. Mean monthly O-3 concentrations varied between 35.3 ppb and 54.2 ppb at the experimental site. EDU treatment positively affected various growth and yield parameters with difference between cultivars. EDU-treated plants showed increase in shoot and root length, leaf area, absolute growth rate, relative growth rate, and net primary productivity, indicating O-3 induced suppression in growth. EDU treatment was highly significant in different cultivars for total biomass and test weight but not for harvest index. Yield per plant was higher by 25.6%, 24%, 20.4%, 8.6%, and 1.9% in EDU-treated cultivars HUW468, Sonalika, HUW510, HUW234, and PBW343, respectively, than non-EDU-treated ones. These results clearly indicate the sensitivity of all the wheat cultivars to ambient levels of O-3 with cv HUW468 appearing to be most sensitive. The present study also supports the view that EDU has great potential in alleviating the unfavorable effects of O-3 and can be effectively used as a monitoring tool to assess growth and yield losses in areas experiencing elevated concentrations of O-3.","[Singh, Shalini; Agrawal, S.

METHODS: A 35-year-old lady presented with pain in the right upper abdomen, and was radiologically found to have a gallbladder mass. A provisional diagnosis of gallbladder carcinoma was made. Laparotomy revealed a 20x20 cm, exophytic, friable growth arising from the fundus of the gallbladder. It was excised with segment IVb and V of the liver and regional lymphadenectomy. RESULT: Histopathological examination revealed it was a neuroendocrine carcinoma, atypical carcinoid of the gallbladder.

Stimulation of a dorsal root evoked monosynaptic reflex potential (MSP) and polysynaptic reflex potential (PSP) in the segmental ventral root in Mg2+-free medium where the voltage-dependent blockade of NMDA receptors is absent. The 5-HT (0.3-50 mu M) in the Mg2+-free medium depressed the MSP and PSP in a concentration-dependent manner. At 30 mu M of 5-HT, the depression was 57% and 95% for MSP and PSP, respectively, and no further depression was seen at 50 mu M. The 5-HT-induced depression of the reflexes in the Mg2+-free medium was blocked by ondansetron (5-HT3 receptor antagonist), but not by spiperone (5-HT2A/2C antagonist). In the Mg2+-free medium, phenylbiguanide (5-HT3 agonist) also depressed the MSP and PSP in a concentration-dependent manner and was blocked by ondansetron. Addition of Mg2+ (1.3 mM) to the medium abolished the PSP and decreased the MSP by 30%. In the presence of Mg2+, 5-HT (1-50 mu M) also depressed the MSP in a concentration-dependent manner. At 10 mu M of 5-HT, there was approximately 20% depression and at 50 mu M the depression was 100%. The 5-HT-induced depression of MSP in the Mg2+-containing medium was antagonized by spiperone (p < 0.05, two-way ANOVA), but not by ondansetron. The results indicate that the 5-HT-induced depression of MSP involves 5-HT3 receptors in the Mg2+-free medium and 5-HT2A/2C in the presence of Mg2+ when NMDA receptors are in the closed state.","[Deshpande, Shripad B.; Maurya, Amar N.; Singh, Jitendra N.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Physiol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Deshpande, SB (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Physiol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",desh48@yahoo.com,"Singh, Jitendra N/R-6723-2019","SINGH, JITENDRA/0000-0003-0045-9295","Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi, India","Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi, India(Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR))","JNS and ANM wish to thank the Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi, India for financial support.",,34,3,3,0,5,POLISH ACAD SCIENCES INST PHARMACOLOGY,KRAKOW,"SMETNA 12, 31-343 KRAKOW, POLAND",1734-1140,,,PHARMACOL REP,Pharmacol.

The present article details the histopathologic observations in the excised specimens of CPC in the neonates operated on for ARM. Material and Methods: Formalin-fixed specimens of CPC were evaluated both grossly and microscopically. They were stained by H&E stain and Masson trichrome stain. Results: Haustrations and tenia coli were uniformly absent in all the CPC specimens. Mucosa showed focal erosion, hemorrhage, and disruption in the muscularis mucosae. Submucosa showed congested blood vessels, hemorrhage, and thrombosis. Both the circular and the longitudinal muscle layers showed hypertrophic and atrophic appearance. Both the muscle layers also showed disruption. There was presence of fibrosis in all the muscular layers on Masson trichrome stain. There was presence of unique constriction bands in the muscularis propria. These were seen as focal dipping and narrowing of the muscular layers at intermittent intervals. They were more prominent in the circular muscle layers. Conclusion: Congenital pouch colon seen in association with ARM is an abnormally developed tissue and needs to be resected for better functional outcome of the remaining gut. However, further physiologic and immunohistochemical studies are warranted to observe the contractile and innervation pattern of CPC. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Pioglitazone group showed favorable reductions in serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol and increase in HDL cholesterol as compared to rosiglitazone group, after 16 weeks of treatment and also with control group. There was significant reduction of CRP level in pioglitazone and rosiglitazone group. The level of serum TNF-alpha decreased significantly in pioglitazone and mildly decreased in rosiglitazone group. The level of VEGF, IL-8 and Angiogenin were increased in pioglitazone than rosiglitazone group. There were no significant changes observed in the serum angiogenin and IL-8 levels in the control group. Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone therapy in type-2 diabetes subjects have additional benefits of reducing mediators of endothelial dysfunction. Increase in angiogenesis markers in patients receiving pioglitazone could have variable effects in diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy as there may be increased vascular neogenesis. Pioglitazone has advantage over rosiglitazone in lowering lipid and proinflammatory cytokines.","[Vijay, Sudarshan K.; Mishra, Manish; Kumar, Hemant; Tripathi, K.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Med, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Tripathi, K (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Med, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",kamlakar_tripathi@yahoo.co.in,"Singh, Rakesh K./AAX-9528-2021; Mishra, Manish/ABO-6147-2022","Mishra, Manish/0000-0003-1620-6022","UGC, India","UGC, India(University Grants Commission, India)","Authors Mr. Manish Mishra and Mr. Hemant Kumar are thankful to UGC, India, for financial support.

The primary objective of the study was to monitor the degree of PAHs load in the nearby sites around TPP compared to distant sites. Total PAH (SPAH) concentrations in the leaves ranged from 372.18 (at control site 7) to 4362.35 ng g(-1) d.w. (at highest polluted site 4). The concentration factors ranged from 2.65 to 11.72 for the sites located at 1 km to the point source and 1.0 to 7.08 for distant sites. The share of carcinogenic PAHs to the total PAHs differed with the site, ranging from 10.76% to 26.92%. The sites located closer to TPP have shown higher concentrations of medium and high molecular weight PAHs, which decreased gradually with the distance from the source. The total PAH burden at control site was dominated by the low and medium molecular weight PAHs compounds viz., naphthalene, acenaphthylene, acenaphthene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene, pyrene, chrysene, coronene., whilst at other sites medium and high PAHs viz., fluoranthene, pyrene, benzo (a) anthracene, chrysene, benzo (b) fluoranthene, benzo (e) pyrene and coronene showed the highest values. These results support the biomonitoring ability of Calotropis gigantea R.Br. leaves to monitor PAHs contamination.","[Sharma, Atul Prakash; Tripathi, B.

Fungal species that cause biodeterioration were isolated from stored food and drug commodities by serial dilutions. A poisoned food technique was adopted to assess fungitoxicity of the plant extract against fungal isolates. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of extracts against two dominant storage fungi, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger, were superior to those of two commonly used synthetic fungicides. Aflatoxin B, synthesis was inhibited at low extract concentrations in SMKY medium. Germination of legume seeds was unaffected by the extract application but rather seedling growth was enhanced. Hence the aqueous extract of A. alliaceum possessed a wide spectrum of fungitoxicity against fungi associated with deterioration of food commodities and herbal drugs.

(Cucurbitaceae)], Camponotus compressus (Fabricius) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) appears to be the ecologically dominant species, due to its abundance and the high frequency of deterrent encounters with the major insect herbivore, Raphidopalpa foveicollis Lucas (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). A significant positive linear correlation was found between the number of extrafloral nectaries per leaf, calyx, bract, and bracteole and the patrolling time of C. compressus, Camponotus paria (Emery), Pheidole spec., and Tetramorium spec. (all Hymenoptera: Formicidae) at the corresponding plant parts. Many one-to-one deterrent interactions between the ant visitors and adult R. foveicollis were recorded, with C. compressus being involved in most encounters on the calyx and bracts, Pheidole spec. on the leaves, and Pachycondyla tesserinoda (Emery) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) on the bracteoles. Tapinoma melanocephalum (Fabr.) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) exhibited significant deterrent effects on adult herbivores on the corolla when in groups larger than 15 ants. Ant exclusion and inclusion experiments revealed a significant reduction in the residence time, as well as dose- and time-dependent reduction in the frequency of visits of the herbivore on crop plants with C. compressus, C. paria, Pheidole spec., and T. melanocephalum ants, compared to the control. Results support the optimal defence hypothesis, as the plant structures most closely linked to plant fitness bear the extrafloral nectaries and are defended by the visiting ant species. This is a valuable, indirect plant-protection strategy of an annual crop plant.","[Agarwal, Vivek M.; Rastogi, Neelkamal] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Ctr Adv Study, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Rastogi, N (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Ctr Adv Study, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",neelkamalrastogi@yahoo.co.in,,,,,,,40,13,19,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-8703,,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

We explore here the utility of a thermodynamically consistent excluded volume model recently proposed by us in explaining the above experimental results and we further compare our results with those obtained from an ideal gas model and other excluded-volume model that are often used in describing a grand canonical statistical system consisting of hot, dense hadron gas. We find that the energy dependence of the total multiplicities of strange and nonstrange hadrons in general shows close agreement with the experimental data, although slight deviation is observed for some multistrange hadrons, e.g., Omega + (Omega) over bar, Xi, and phi. The difference observed in these cases does not clearly support our assumption of the same freeze-out volume of the fireball that homogeneously emit all kinds of particles. Similarly we have calculated the ratios for particles and antiparticles such as K-/K+, (p) over bar /p, (Lambda) over bar/Lambda, (Xi) over bar/Xi and (Omega) over bar/Omega, as well as the ratios of the unequal mass particles < K+>/<pi(+)>, < K->/<pi(-)>, <Lambda >/<pi >, <Xi(-)>/<pi >, <Omega + (Xi) over bar >/<pi > and <phi >/<pi > and studied their variations with respect to the center-of-mass energy in the excluded-volume models and, finally, the results are compared with the experimental data. We find that in some cases, although the calculated results show close agreements with the experimental data, the deviations between theory and experiment in cases of unequal mass and multistrange particle ratios, like <Lambda >/<pi >, <Xi(-)>/<pi >, <Omega +(Xi) over bar > /<pi >, <phi >/<pi >. etc., appear to be quite large and thus warrant further investigations on the suitability of thermal hadron gas models.","[Mishra, M.; Singh, C.

In the present investigation, we have synthesized nanostructured TiO2 photocatalysts, which have been used in the photocatalytic degradation of phenol (one of the most common water pollutants). These catalysts have been prepared through sol-gel technique using titanium tetra-isopropoxide as a raw material for synthesis. Characterization techniques such as XRD, SEM and TEM have been employed for structural/microstructural investigations. XRD results show that the as synthesized TiO2 nanopowder exhibit anatase phase, TiO2. The average sizes of the TiO2 nanopowders are similar to 5-10 nm. The optical properties of the samples were investigated through UV-visible and fluorescence techniques. It has been observed that absorption edge corresponds to similar to 410 nm (band-gap, similar to 3.02 eV). The emission peak in the fluorescence spectrum at similar to 418 nm corresponds to the bandgap energy of similar to 2.97 eV. Concentration of phenol (initial concentration, similar to 100 ppm) with illumination time was monitored by measuring the absorbance of pure and illuminated phenol through UV-visible spectrophotometer. Salient feature of this study relates to the fact that the present sol-gel synthesized TiO2 nanopowders have been found to be better photocatalysts for phenol degradation than the presently employed commercial TiO2 (P-25, Degussa) photocatalyst. Thus, whereas phenol concentration, with the presently synthesized TiO2 nanopowders, the concentration of phenol decreases up to similar to 32% but for commercial TiO2 nanopowder (P-25, Degussa), it decreased only up to similar to 25%. The improved surface area is considered as an important factor for the aforesaid decrease in phenol concentration.","[Mishra, P. R.; Srivastava, O.

To study the clinico-hematological profile and treatment outcome in children suffering from auto immune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Methods. Twelve children were diagnosed with auto immune hemolytic anemia over a period of four years. Direct antiglobulin test was positive in all the cases. Other causes of hemolytic anemia like thalassemia syndromes, hereditary spherocytosis, G6PD deficiency were excluded by appropriate tests. The children were followed up for 6 months to 4 years. Results. The age ranged from 7 mth to 9 yr with a mean age of 4.51 yr. All patients had pallor as the presenting complaint followed by splenomegaly (83.3%), jaundice (66.7%), fever (50%) and bleeding manifestations (16.7%). 9 patients had primary disease and 3 had secondary disease. Tubercular infection was seen in 2 patients with secondary disease. Jaundice was seen equally in both the groups. Oral prednisolone produced remission in 83.3% cases. 4 patients (3 in primary and one in secondary group) had relapse after initial response. All responded to a second course of steroids but had subsequent relapses and developed a chronic course. Conclusion. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is an uncommon cause of hemolytic anemia in children. Tubercular infection is an underlying pathology in cases of secondary autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Although oral steroids induce remission in most of the cases, relapses are common.","[Gupta, V.; Bhatia, B.

The underlying cell signaling pathways for the cardiac dysrhythmias produced by MBT venom are not known. The present study was therefore conducted to delineate the second messenger signaling pathways involved in MBT venom-induced atrial rhythm changes. The effects of venom and various antagonists were examined on spontaneously beating rat right atrial preparations in vitro. The MBT-venom produced an increase (35%), a decrease (45%) and again an increase (50%) in rate at 0.03, 0.3 and 3.0 mu g/ml of venom, respectively. On the other hand, force of contraction exhibited a concentration-dependent rise (up to 40%) at all concentrations of venom. Pretreatment with atropine (0.3 mu M) blocked the decrease in atrial rate at 0.3 mu g/ml concentration of venom while no such blockade was seen in force of contraction. Submaximal concentration of ACh (0.1 nM) decreased the atrial rate by 25%. In the presence of MBT venom (0.3 mu g/ml), ACh-induced fall in atrial rate was enhanced. The venom-induced fall in atria] rate and augmentation of ACh response were blocked by pertussis toxin (PTx; a G(i)-inhibitor) or methylene blue (a G-cyclase inhibitor). The results indicate that the decrease in atrial rate produced by venom is mediated muscarinic by receptors via G(i)-guanylyl cyclase mediated cell signaling pathways.","[Deshpande, Shripad B.; Kanoo, Sadhana; Alex, Anitha B.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Physiol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Deshpande, SB (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Physiol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",desh48@yahoo.com,,,,,,,16,6,7,0,2,NATL INST SCIENCE COMMUNICATION-NISCAIR,NEW DELHI,"DR K S KRISHNAN MARG, PUSA CAMPUS, NEW DELHI 110 012, INDIA",0019-5189,0975-1009,,INDIAN J EXP BIOL,Indian J.

Despite its high incidence, it is unusual to find microfilaria in fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) smears. We present a case of subcutaneous firm to cystic swelling, aspiration of which revealed a large number of microfilaria. Case A 30-year-old man presented with a chain of intermittent, firm swellings in both arms. FNAC of the swellings revealed a large number of microfilariae with associated giant cell reaction and inflammatory cell-like eosinophils.

We first recall that spherical stars/galaxies acquire unbounded radii, become infinitely massive, and evaporate away continuously if one uses the standard Maxwellian distribution f(B) (which maximizes the usual Boltzmann-Shannon entropy and hence has a tail extending to infinity). Next, we show that these troubles disappear automatically if we employ the exact most probable distribution f (which maximizes the combinatorial entropy and hence possesses a sharp cutoff tail). Finally, if astronomical observation is carried out on a large galaxy, then the Poisson equation together with thermal de Broglie wavelength provides useful information about the cutoff radius r(K), cutoff energy epsilon(K), and the huge quantum number K up to which the cluster exists. Thereby, a refinement over the empirical lowered isothermal King models, is achieved. Numerically, we find that the most probable distribution (MPD) prediction fits well the number density profile near the outer edge of globular clusters.

Ti powder can be directly used for doping in the preparation of Ti doped NaAlH4 materials (Ti:NaAlH4). Out of various materials corresponding to NaAlH4-x mol% Ti (x = 1, 2, 3,4,5,6), we have found that the material with x = 3 mol% is the optimum material. It shows the maximum storage capacity similar to 5.23 wt% for the first two reactions at 150 and 210 degrees C, respectively. The first decomposition reaction of Ti doped NaAlH4 material was found to depend upon milling time. The optimum milling time for Ti doping was 10 min under argon atmosphere at 1500 rpm. The desorption kinetics improved nearly three times for Ti doped materials as compared to the procured materials. Rehydrogenation occurred at 110 degrees C under similar to 10 MPa pressure in hydrogen environment within 8 h. The hydrogen storage capacity of this material was found to gradually decrease to 2.93 wt% after 15th cycles.

In order to know the quality and/or suitability of groundwater for domestic and irrigation in upper Gunjanaeru River basin, 51 water samples in post-monsoon and 46 in pre-monsoon seasons were collected and analyzed for various parameters. Geological units are alluvium, shale and quartzite. Based on the analytical results, chemical indices like percent sodium, sodium adsorption ratio, residual sodium carbonate, permeability index (PI) and chloroalkaline indices were calculated. The pre-monsoon waters have low sodium hazard as compared to post-monsoon season. Residual sodium carbonate values revealed that one sample is not suitable in both the seasons for irrigation purposes due the occurrence of alkaline white patches and low permeability of the soil. PI values of both seasons revealed that the ground waters are generally suitable for irrigation. The positive values of Chloroalkaline indices in post-monsoon (80%) and in pre-monsoon (59%) water samples indicate absence of base-exchange reaction (chloroalkaline disequilibrium), and remaining samples of negative values of the ratios indicate base-exchange reaction (chloroalkaline equilibrium). Chadha rectangular diagram for geochemical classification and hydrochemical processes of groundwater for both seasons indicates that most of waters are Ca-Mg-HCO3 type. Assessment of water samples from various methods indicated that majority of the water samples in both seasons are suitable for different purposes except at Yanadipalle (sample no. 8) that requires precautionary measures. The overall quality of groundwater in post-monsoon season in all chemical constituents is on the higher side due to dissolution of surface pollutants during the infiltration and percolation of rainwater and at few places due to agricultural and domestic activities.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Geol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Raju, NJ (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Geol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",rajunj7@yahoo.com,,,,,,,25,121,127,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0943-0105,,,ENVIRON GEOL,Environ.

PRL or GH induced TNF-alpha production by murine macrophages was insensitive in the presence of competitive inhibitor of NOS, L-NMMA. Similarly, there is no autocrine or paracrine effect of TNF-alpha on GH or PRL induced NO production and iNOS expression. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The total prevalence of variation was 12.8% (CI, 7.6-17.4) and it was found in 13.2% (CI, 7.5-18) of male and in 10.7% (CI, -0.6-19.6) of female cadavers. These variations were divided into three groups. The first group was abnormal location of the cords, which was either posterolateral or anteromedial in relation to the axillary artery. in 2.3% (CI, 0.1-4.5) cadavers. The lateral cord and the medial root of the median nerve had received communicating branches from the posterior cord in most of the cases of this group. The second group was absence of the posterior cord in 3.5% (CI, 0.7-6.1) of cadavers. The lateral and medial cords of this group were connected with the communicating branches, which had a course in front of the axillary artery. The third group was abnormal formation and course of the median nerve in 7% (CI, 3.1-10.6) of cadavers. In all cases of this group the medial root received communicating branch/branches either from the lateral or posterior cord. In eight (4.7%) cadavers, both roots of the median nerve were joined on medial side of the axillary artery to form a median nerve, which traveled medial to the artery. In four (2.3%) cadavers the roots of the median nerve did not join and both traveled separately anteromedial to the axillary and brachial arteries. This study indicates that all three cords and median nerve vary considerably in levels of origin, location and course in relation to the axillary artery and these variable cases were joined with the communicating branch/branches. The observed variations are of anatomical and clinical interest. These kinds of variations are more prone to injury in radical neck dissection and in other surgical operation of the axilla.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Anat, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Surg, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Pandey, SK (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Anat, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",pandeyskbhu@rediffmail.com,,"Shukla, Vijay/0000-0002-2585-3478",,,,,29,51,55,0,9,WILEY-LISS,HOBOKEN,"DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA",0897-3806,,,CLIN ANAT,Clin.

It occurs in small, irregular patches and pockets within the magnesite and sometimes with dolomite. Talc in the interstitial spaces of magnesite occurs as fillings of stylolitic veins, as well as in patches heavily corroding the magnesite grains lying in contact. Tremolite, chlorite and other low grade metamorphic minerals are absent while chalcedony is sometimes present in intimate association with talc in the stylolitic veins and in the patches. Talc is extremely fine-grained, sometimes scaly and at times fibrous. These features indicate that talc is neither hydrothermal in origin nor is produced by stresses acting on the carbonate rock. Presence of pyrite grains in talc and host magnesite is indicative of a reducing environment. X-ray diffraction and infrared studies reveal that there is no other metamorphic mineral present. Fluid-inclusion study of host magnesite suggests that the minimum temperature of homogenization (Th) ranges between 220 and 300 degrees C. The antipathic relationship between silica and talc suggests that the latter is a product of diagenetic processes, being formed by reaction of magnesite and silica at temperature less than 300 degrees C.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Geol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Sengupta, HP (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Geol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",sengupta_hari@yahoo.com,,,,,,,17,2,3,0,7,CURRENT SCIENCE ASSN,BANGALORE,"C V RAMAN AVENUE, PO BOX 8005, BANGALORE 560 080, INDIA",0011-3891,,,CURR SCI INDIA,Curr.

Bulk polycrystalline samples have been prepared by two-step solid-state reaction route at ambient pressure. It has been observed that simultaneous substitution of Sb and Pb at Hg site in oxygen deficient HgO delta layer of HgBa2Ca2-Cu(3)O8 +delta cuprate high-T-c superconductor leads to the formation of Hg-1223 as the dominant phase. Microstructural investigations of the as grown samples employing scanning electron microscopy reveal single crystal like large grains embodying spiral like features. Superconducting properties particularly transport current density (J(ct)) have been found to be sensitive to these microstructural features. As for example (Hg0.08Sb0.05Pb0.15)Ba2Ca2Cu3O8+delta compound which exhibits single crystal like large grains (similar to 50 mu m) and appears to result through spiral growth mechanism, shows highest J(ct) (similar to 1.85 x 10(3) A/cm(2)) at 77K. A possible mechanism for the generation of spiral like features and correlation between microstructural features and superconducting properties have been put forward.

Gallbladder muscular strips ( 2 - 3 mm wide and 15 - 20 mm long) from patients undergoing cholecystectomy were used for recording the in vitro contractions evoked by electrical and chemical ( carbachol, histamine, or cholecystokinin) stimulation. Stimulation of strips with trains of pulses (5-msec duration, 70 V at 100 Hz) of varying train durations (0.01 to 9 sec) elicited duration-dependent increase in the amplitude of contractions and the maximal contractions were seen with 5 sec. Atropine ( 0.4 muM) significantly attenuated these contractions, leaving about 34% of contractions, which in turn was abolished by xylocaine. Carbachol produced a concentration-dependent (0.004 - 0.4 muM) increase in force of contraction and the maximal response was seen at 0.4 muM and abolished by atropine (0.4 muM). Histamine also produced contractions and the maximal contractions were about 35% of the maximal carbachol response. Histamine-induced contractions were not abolished by atropine but were abolished by xylocaine. CCK up to 10 muM failed to evoke any contraction, even though the strips were responsive to carbachol. The results indicate that cholelithiatic gallbladders exhibited responses to electrical stimulation through cholinergic and histaminergic plexuses and they were insensitive to CCK.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Physiol, Inst Med Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Surg, Inst Med Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Deshpande, SB (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Physiol, Inst Med Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",desh48@yahoo.com,,"Shukla, Vijay/0000-0002-2585-3478",,,,,37,3,4,0,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0163-2116,1573-2568,,DIGEST DIS SCI,Dig.

It was shown that an increase in the concentration of the adsorptive (10(-7)-10(-2) M), temperature (303-333 K) and pH (ca. 3-10) enhanced the removal of these ions. The first-order uptake of Hg(II) ions conformed to the Freundlich and Dubinin and Radushkevich (D-R) isotherms over the entire adsorptive concentration range (10(-7)-10(-2) M), whereas the Langmuir isotherm was followed only at moderate concentrations. Thermal data showed that this process was endothermic in nature. The radiation stability of polyaniline was also investigated by exposing it to an 11.1 GBq (Ra/Be) source associated with gamma-dose of 1.72 Gy/h. Irradiation had practically no significant effect on the adsorption capacity of polyaniline. Desorption experiments showed that the process of Hg(II) ion adsorption by polyaniline was almost irreversible and chemisorptive in nature.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Mol Elect Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; Banaras Hindu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Nucl & Radiochem Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Shankar, S (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Mol Elect Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",somshankarbhu@yahoo.co.in,"DUBEY, SOM SHANKAR/A-5408-2011","DUBEY, SOM SHANKAR/0000-0002-5294-1596",,,,,34,12,12,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0263-6174,2048-4038,,ADSORPT SCI TECHNOL,Adsorpt.

The effect of various thiols like 2-mercaptoethanol (ME), DL-dithiothreitol (DTT), and L-cysteine was investigated. The enzyme was significantly activated by thiol and the order of effectiveness as activator was ME > DTT > cysteine. All the thiols exhibited two peaks of activation, one at lower concentration and another at higher concentration. Time-dependent activation of urease exhibited very rapid activation; about 5.3-fold with 8.0 mM ME and 4.9-fold with 30 muM DTT within 10 min of treatment. Moreover, the inhibition caused by high urea concentration was completely abolished by ME. Cysteine and DTT were ineffective in abolishing high substrate inhibition. Enzyme pretreated with ME also exhibited elevated activity in the urea concentration range of 10-2000 mM. The significance of these observations is discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

It was found that in vivo administration of aqueous thymic extract obtained from thymus of normal mice or thyalpha1 could activate the TAM to produce enhanced amount of NO which was further augmented on in vivo treatment of these TAM by LPS. These observations suggest that thyalpha1 could prime TAM for activation by second signal of LPS. The study also presents evidence that tumor cell elaborate factors that enhance the effect of thyalpha1 on TAM for production of NO.

Thus, in these areas amphotericin B remains the only drug; although it cures > 97% patients, infusion-related adverse events are common and occasionally serious toxicity, such as myocarditis, or death can occur. In recent years India has been the center for clinical development of new anti-leishmanial drugs like lipid formulations of amphotericin B, new drugs like parenterally administered aminosidine and oral miltefosine.

In addition to the monotherapy, efforts in development of combination chemotherapy are needed if the menace of drug resistance is to be contained. Pentavalent antimonial compound sodium stibogluconate (Sb-v) or meglumine antimoniate have been the mainstay in the treatment of kala-azar, being used as first-line drug [2]. In late seventies it was realized that the prevailing Sb-v regimen of 10 mg/kg for 6-10 days left a large proportion of patients unresponsive [14]. This led to successive recommendations to increase the dosage and duration of the drug [27, 28] and currently 20 mg/kg daily for 30-40 days form the standard therapy. Increased dosage and duration of Sb-v treatment seemed to work initially; however, the current data show increasing antimony unresponsiveness with these regimen [22, 26, 8]. Increase in the total quantity of Sbv to six times or more from previous levels has resulted in increased severe toxicity (7-10%) and deaths (5-10%) [22, 26, 15, 18]. Investigations to look at the in vitro sensitivity patterns of the parasites, recovered from patients responding to Sb-v and non-responders, points strongly to the emergence of antimony-resistant strains in India [10].","Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Med, Kalaazar Med Res Ctr, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Sundar, S (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Med, Kalaazar Med Res Ctr, 6,SK Gupta Nagar,Lanka, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",,,,,,,,28,43,44,0,5,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0300-8584,,,MED MICROBIOL IMMUN,Med.

The results show that these coals are sub-bituminous 'C' to high Volatile bituminous 'C' in rank and have requisite petrographic characteristics to act as a potential source for the generation of significant amount of normal hydrocarbons. The values of vitrinite reflectance, particularly of the coals of Meghalaya and Assam, suggest a maturation close to the 'top oil window' (birth line).

Upon reduction, proteins attain different conformations with varying degrees of compactness. The reduction of papain in the presence of 8 M urea leads to the partial reduction of one disulfide bond. This derivative (single disulfide reduced carboxymethylated 1RCM papain (3RCM papain)) was characterized by spectroscopic methods and the effect of this reduction on the unfolding of the protein was investigated. Under this partial reduction, papain exhibits more than half of the tertiary and most of the secondary structures relative to the non-reduced molecule (free cysteine reduced and carboxymethylated papain (1RCM papain)). Hydrophobic regions are exposed to the solvent as observed through 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid binding which was absent in the fully intact and unfolded protein, at neutral pH. Hydrodynamic studies indicated that 3RCM papain, under neutral conditions, possess expanded conformation as compared to the native protein. Tryptophan fluorescence quenching studies suggested the exposure of aromatic residues to solvent. Guanidine hydrochloride induced unfolding of this derivative, at neutral pH, showed a non-cooperative transition contrary to the cooperativity seen with intact protein. Thermal unfolding indicates that 3RCM papain is less stable compared to the intact protein. These findings suggest that partial reduction of papain has a significant effect on the unfolding behavior of papain. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Tuberculous meningitis is an important manifestation and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis is based on clinical features, cerebrospinal fluid changes, and imaging characteristics. Bacteriological confirmation is not possible in all cases as serological tests do not have sufficient sensitivity and specificity. The polymerase chain reaction shows promise for the future. Appropriate chemotherapeutic agents should be administered as early as possible, although there is no unanimity concerning chemotherapeutic regimens or optimal duration of treatment. The patient's clinical stage at presentation is the most important prognostic factor. The role of corticosteroids is controversial but they should be administered to all patients presenting in stage III. Surgical procedures are directed at management of the hydrocephalus. Focal lesions, intracranial tuberculomas, and tuberculous abscesses, are usually located in cerebral or cerebellar hemispheres, uncommonly in brainstem and very rarely in spinal cord.

The small sized Navicula cryptocephala became dominant in cultures which did not receive P pulses. Therefore, this species seems to be affinity specialist well-adapted to a low P concentration. The replacement of the dominant cyanobacterium Gomphosphaeria aponina by the diatoms Navicula cryptocephala and Synedra ulna in the control and P-pulsed cultures might be due to another factor. The large sized Phormidium mucosum and Hormidium sp. were favoured in cultures pulsed with P at the lowest frequency, which seems to be due mainly to their larger P accumulation capacity. Synedra ulna was favoured to the same extent under the 2 and 6-day pulse periods.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Bot, Algal Biol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Gaur, JP (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Bot, Algal Biol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",jpgaur@banaras.ernet.in,,,,,,,28,5,5,0,11,EDP SCIENCES S A,LES ULIS CEDEX A,"17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE",0003-4088,2100-000X,,ANN LIMNOL-INT J LIM,Ann.

The hydrogen storage material (MH) has been synthesized through thermal and spin melting techniques. A comparative study of materials synthesized by these two techniques with emphasis on the characteristics relevant to battery electrode applications has been carried out. In the present study, the modified composition of AB(5)-type corresponds to the spin as well as thermal melted versions of MmNi(4.3)Al(0.3)Mn(0.4) and MmNi(4.0)Al(0.3)Mn(0.4)Si(0.3). Structural characterization has revealed that, whereas for the spin melted MmNi(4.3)Al(0.3)Mn(0.4) the dominant growth is perpendicular to the c-axis, it is parallel to the c-axis for MmNi(4.0)Al(0.3)Mn(0.4)Si(0.3). The hydrogenation behaviour of these materials has been monitored through P-C-T and kinetic curves. Attempts have been made to establish a correlation between the structure and hydrogenation behaviour. The spin melted material (MmNi(4.3)Al(0.3)Mn(0.4)) exhibits reduced pulverization and hence is expected to have increased cycle life. This version of the material also exhibits higher storage capacity, faster kinetics and faster activation as compared to the conventionally prepared bulk form. The bulk version of the alloy with silicon has been found to undergo easy activation (2nd cycle) as compared to the bulk version of the alloy without silicon (6th cycle). The spin melted version of the material with silicon leads to smaller (finer) particle size material compared to the alloy form without silicon.

The satellite DNA-containing chromatin exhibits lower accessibility to endogenous endonucleases in old rats. The nucleosomal repeat length of this chromatin as investigated from digestion with endogenous endonucleases and MNase differs remarkably from bulk chromatin, though it does not alter with age. However, age-dependent loss of satellite DNA is apparent from hybridization results. Furthermore, DNase I analysis of the satellite DNA-containing chromatin al nucleosomal level reveals a relatively loose organization in young rats than old ones. It also shows an altered 10 bp periodicity as compared to bulk chromatin in both ages. These findings establish organizational differences between rat liver bulk and satellite DNA-containing chromatin.

The films with x ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 exhibit high-temperature superconductivity at temperatures falling in the range from 115 to 125 K. The sample with optimum doping of Pb of x = 0.2 shows the highest T-c similar to 125 K. Ag admiring at low concentrations has been found to improve J(c). Thus for Ag-0.02, i.e. Hg0.8Pb0.2Ba2Ca2Cu3O8+delta(Ag-0.02) T-c decreased minimally from 125 K to 124 K and the critical current density has been found to increase to similar to 1.2 x 10(3) A cm(-2) from 7.8 x 10(2) A cm(-2). However, higher Ag concentrations, e.g. Ag-y (y > 0.05), in contrast to the case of other HTSC cuprates, have been found to be detrimental to superconducting properties, particularly J(c). The microstructural details as revealed through scanning electron microscopy exhibit the curious characteristic of the existence of spiral-like growth features for lower Ag concentrations, which are found to disappear for higher Ag concentrations.",,,"Kumari, S (corresponding author), BANARAS HINDU UNIV,DEPT PHYS,VARANASI 221005,UTTAR PRADESH,INDIA.",,"Anand, Suman/X-5789-2019",,,,,,24,5,6,0,4,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL, ENGLAND BS1 6BE",0953-2048,,,SUPERCOND SCI TECH,Supercond.

With an excess of sodium borohydride in methanol, one of the carbonyls of the hydrazone is reduced to -CHOH and the -N = CCH3R is transformed into -NH-CHCH3R. Highly shielded N'-alkyl protons in H-1 NMR indicate that N'-alkyls are right over the cage phenyl ring, which would result from the non-inverting pyramidal geometry of the exocyclic nitrogen. A strong repulsion between the lone electron pair of Nsp(3)- and the pi-electrons of the phenyl ring has been attributed to the restricted inversion of pyramidal nitrogen. Diastereomeric nature of the methyl protons indicates two conformations about Nsp(3)-Csp(3) bond which have been shown in the population ratio of 1:2. The -OH group of the pyrrolidine ring has been proposed to be exo-to the cage. 5-Acetoxy-N'-acetyl, derivative exhibits restricted relation about the N-N bond and a preferred conformation with the N'-alkyl in syn-orientation, which supports the proposed stereochemistry of the -OH group.","BANARAS HINDU UNIV, DEPT CHEM, VARANASI 221005, UTTAR PRADESH, INDIA",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),,,,,,,,,22,3,3,0,8,NATL INST SCIENCE COMMUNICATION & INFORMATION RESOURCES-NISCAIR,NEW DELHI,"DR K S KRISHNAN MARG, PUSA CAMPUS, NEW DELHI, 110 012, INDIA",0376-4699,0019-5103,,INDIAN J CHEM B,Indian J.

The experimental methods used were the open-field, elevated plus-maze, social interaction and novelty-suppressed feeding latency tests. Caffeine produced a dose-related profile of behavioural changes, which were qualitatively similar to those induced by yohimbine and which indicate an anxiogenic activity in rodents. Thus, both the drugs reduced ambulation and rears, and increased immobility and defaecation in the open-field test. They decreased the number of entries and time spent on the open arms of the elevated-plus maze, reduced social interaction in paired rats and increased the feeding latency in an unfamiliar environment in 48-h food-deprived rats. Lorazepam, a well known benzodiazepine anxiolytic agent, attenuated the anxiogenic effects of caffeine and yohimbine. Subchronic administration of caffeine (50 mg/kg, i.p.) for 21 days, in different groups of animals, induced a significant degree of tolerance in the elevated plus-maze test, which was statistically significant after 14 and 21 days' treatment. Yohimbine, however, did not induce similar tolerance. When caffeine (50 mg/kg, i.p.) was withdrawn after 21 days' administration, to a separate group of rats, significant withdrawal anxiety was observed 48 h later as noted in the elevated plus-maze test. The investigations support clinical evidence of caffeine-induced anxiety, tolerance to anxiety on continued use, and withdrawal anxiety in chronic caffeine-containing beverage users.",,,"Bhattacharya, SK (corresponding author), BANARAS HINDU UNIV, INST MED SCI, DEPT PHARMACOL, NEUROPHARMACOL LAB, VARANASI 221005, UTTAR PRADESH, INDIA.",,,,,,,,41,86,87,1,25,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"6 BONHILL STREET, LONDON, ENGLAND EC2A 4PU",0269-8811,,,J PSYCHOPHARMACOL,J.

The ARO becomes affected via the circulatory system. The mucous cells of these two tissues show the earliest toxic manifestation in the form of periodic fluctuations in their density, as well as staining properties. The marked toxicopathological alterations in the ARO include periodic necrosis and sloughing off of the respiratory epithelium, leading to haemorrhage and lamellar deformity, followed by their regeneration and hyperplasia. However, the lamellar elements re-differentiate on each occasion from the focal inflammatory tissues. Deposition of a large quantity of glycogen in the muscles is also indicative of disturbed aerial respiration. Damage to gills include periodic lifting of the respiratory epithelium, followed by its sloughing, vacuolization and extensive fusion of secondary lamellae, resulting in reduced respiratory area. Uncontrolled hyperplasia of epithelial cells following regeneration also increases gas diffusion distance. Certain similarities in the histopathological manifestations in these two tissues are possibly due to their common embryonic origin. Hence, the study of the histopathology of ARO of exposed Heteropneustes fossilis can also he used as a potential bioindicator to monitor altered water quality.","BANARAS HINDU UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, HISTOCHEM & HISTOPATHOL LAB, VARANASI 221005, UTTAR PRADESH, INDIA",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),,,"Hemalatha, S/AAF-3638-2021",,,,,,44,8,9,1,2,UNIV ZAGREB VET FACULTY,ZAGREB,"P O BOX 190, 41001 ZAGREB, CROATIA",0372-5480,1331-8055,,VET ARHIV,Vet.

Besides regular repeat pattern, a major portion of the satellite chromatin forms higher order organization. Digestion kinetics confirms condensation of satellite DNA-containing chromatin similar to that of bulk chromatin in old age. Furthermore, densitometric scanning of the slot-blot of soluble chromatin fractions reveals loss of satellite DNA in the old.

The treatments resulted in significant reductions of plasma GTH and estradiol-17 beta levels, the gonadosomatic index, frequency distribution of vitellogenic and postvitellogenic oocytes, and ovarian and serum (32)p- labelled alkali-labile phosphoprotein (a marker of vitellogenic activity). Most of the oocytes were nonvitellogenic or had undergone atretic changes. The hepatic (32)p-phosphoprotein content increased significantly over the saline control value. The effects were similar and pronounced in the p-CPA and melatonin-treated groups but were moderate in the alpha-MPT-treated group. Hypothalamic 5-HT content and turnover were significantly inhibited in the p-CPA and melatonin-treated groups but the content and turnover of catecholamines were not. The alpha-MPT treatment decreased significantly the content and turnover of dopamine (DA), noradrenaline (NA), and adrenaline (A) but did not influence the 5-HT content or turnover. These results suggest that 5-HT, NA and A are stimulatory to GTH secretion and that melatonin may act on the serotonergic system to inhibit the pituitary-gonadal axis.","BANARAS HINDU UNIV,CTR ADV STUDY ZOOL,VARANASI 221005,UTTAR PRADESH,INDIA",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),,,"Joy, Keerikkattil/B-2905-2009",,,,,,28,17,18,0,1,KUGLER PUBLICATIONS BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 11188, 1001 GD AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0920-1742,,,FISH PHYSIOL BIOCHEM,Fish Physiol.

Interaction of UV-B (12.9 mWm-2 nm-1 for 12 and 25 min) and Cu2+ (0.3 and 0.5 mug ml-1) significantly increased the respiration rate and caused a shift from O2-evolution to O2-consumption. PSII exhibited the highest sensitivity to UV-B and Cu. A failure to restore DCPIP photoreduction by artificial electron donors (DPC, NH2OH and MnCl2) suggested that UV-B primarily inhibits the PSII reaction centre. Cu, however, reacts at multiple sites of the electron transport chain. The reduction and blue shifting of absorption peaks, suppression of fluorescence intensity and the excitation spectra indicate the involvement of phycobiliproteins in the inhibition of PSII activity. The synergistic interaction of UV-B and Cu appears due to increased Cu uptake brought about by an altered membrane permeability as a result of peroxidation of membrane lipids in the UV-B exposed cells.",,,"RAI, LC (corresponding author), BANARAS HINDU UNIV,DEPT BOT,ALGAL BIOL LAB,VARANASI 221005,UTTAR PRADESH,INDIA.",,,"Mallick, Nirupama/0000-0002-9969-0464",,,,,33,46,53,0,9,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0098-8472,,,ENVIRON EXP BOT,Environ.

The present study demonstrates that temperature has no apparent effect on the determination of sex. In embryos reared at higher temperature (32 degrees, 34 degrees, 35 degrees C), the gonads differentiate earlier than in controls and the overall duration of embryonic incubation is dramatically reduced. Exogenous administration of testosterone (100 mu g/egg) to embryos of stages 28, 30, and 33 results in the majority of them developing into males; no female is encountered. Testosterone also accelerates the differentiation of testes. Estradiol (5, 10, 15 mu g/egg), administered at the same stages as testosterone, does not show any effect on gonadal differentiation. These results indicate that in C. versicolor, female is the default sex and the male is heterogametic.

Infusions were made in the unanesthetized and unrestrained animals through stainless steel cannulae, chronically implanted into the anteroventral part of third ventricle, Control rats received intraventricular infusions of artificial cerebrospinal fluid. All of the chloride solutions, irrespective of the associated cations, elicited hyperthermia, whereas bicarbonates had hypothermic effect. Responses of chloride and bicarbonate solutions varied significantly (p < 0.001). There was, however, cationic modification of the anionic responses. Thus, sodium ions manifested hyperthermic modifications, accentuating hyperthermia of chloride and attenuating hypothermic effect of bicarbonate. Calcium and potassium ions exerted hypothermic modulation. The results suggest that anionic concentration of intraventricular CSF is crucial for central regulation of body temperature in unanesthetized conscious rats.

Tween 80 enhances the activity of both protease and alpha-amylase. Sodium lauryl sulfate and Aerosol OT, which are ionic surfactants, enhance the activity of protease, but inhibit the activity of alpha-amylase. Cetyl pyridinium chloride, however, enhances the activity of alpha-amylase, but inhibits the activity of protease. Enhanced activity is generally severalfold greater in comparison to the activity observed in the usual aqueous system in the absence of reversed micelles. It has also been observed that the enhanced activity of the enzymes entrapped inside the reversed micelles remains preserved for a much longer period of time in comparison to the activity in the,usual aqueous systems. These observations, which support the view that with proper choice of surfactant and the organic solvent, reversed micelles act like a microreactor that provides a favorable aqueous microenvironment for enzyme activity, have biotechnological overtones.","BANARAS HINDU UNIV,FAC SCI,DEPT CHEM,VARANASI 221005,UTTAR PRADESH,INDIA; BANARAS HINDU UNIV,FAC SCI,DEPT BIOCHEM,VARANASI 221005,UTTAR PRADESH,INDIA",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),,,,"Srivastava, Ramesh/0000-0003-2421-708X",,,,,14,14,15,0,8,HUMANA PRESS INC,TOTOWA,"999 RIVERVIEW DRIVE SUITE 208, TOTOWA, NJ 07512",0273-2289,,,APPL BIOCHEM BIOTECH,Appl.

Adaptive changes in serotonin (5-HT) receptor functioning appears to play an important role in mediating the action of various antidepressant treatments. We investigated the adaptive changes in behavioral sensitivity of the 5-HT receptor subtype following 4 weeks of swimming exercise in normal rats, as well as in an animal model of depression (3 week, variety of chronic stressors). 5-HT1A autoreceptor sensitivity was assessed by hyperphagic response induced by 8-OH-DPAT (0.25 mg/kg, IP); 5-HT1A postsynaptic receptor by 5-HT syndrome induced by 8-OH-DPAT (0.75 mg/kg, IP), and 5 Me-ODMT (5 mg/kg, IP); and 5-HT2 receptor by wet dog shakes response induced by quipazine (1 mg/kg, IP) and 5MeODMT (5 mg/kg, IP). It was observed that exercise training in normal rats resulted in enhanced sensitivity of the 5-HT2 receptors along with subsensitivity of 5-HT,, autoreceptors. Exercise, given prophylactically along with chronic stressors, was able to prevent the development of behavioral deficit in the open-field test, and the animals developed remarkably enhanced sensitivity of 5-HT2 receptors. This adaptive supersensitivity of 5-HT2 receptor is also seen after various antidepressant treatments and may play an important role in mediating the antidepressant action of exercise.","BANARAS HINDU UNIV, DEPT PHYSIOL, NEUROPHYSIOL UNIT, VARANASI 221005, UTTAR PRADESH, INDIA; BANARAS HINDU UNIV, INST MED SCI, DEPT KAYACHIKITSA, VARANASI 221005, UTTAR PRADESH, INDIA",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),,,,,,,,,52,41,41,0,11,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0031-9384,,,PHYSIOL BEHAV,Physiol.

Simultaneously the epithelium regenerates causing hyperplasia of its cells and increased gas diffusion distance impairing normal aerial respiration. Also the number of foldings decreases and the secondary lamella like structures fuse together. This results in smoothening of the inner lining of the air sac. Later reappearance of the blood islets, secondary lamellae and foldings of the inner lining are observed along with the repair of the epithelium.

The study indicates that the monsoon rainfall shows a strong and significant direct relationship with SOI for the concurrent, succeeding autumn and succeeding winter seasons. The magnitude of the direct correlation coefficient for the SOI using (I - D) is enhanced over all India and peninsular India if the above seasons happen to be associated with an easterly phase of the QBO (Quasi-Biennial Oscillation) at 50 mb. The result indicates that the strength of the monsoon plays an important role in the following southern oscillation events in the Pacific Ocean. The premonsoon tendency of the SOI anomaly spring minus winter SOI shows a significant positive correlation with monsoon rainfall over all India, northwest India and peninsular India. The absolute value of the positive correlation coefficient becomes highly enhanced over all India, northwest India as well as peninsular India if the 6-month period from December to March is associated with the westerly phase of the QBO. Hence, the premonsoon SOI tendency parameter can be a useful predictor of Indian monsoon rainfall especially if it happens to be associated with the westerly QBO. Significant negative association is also found between the anomaly of monsoon onset dates and SOI of the previous spring season, the absolute value being higher for SOI (T - D) than for SOI (I - D). The negative correlation coefficient becomes enhanced if the previous springs are associated with a westerly phase of the QBO. It shows that the previous spring SOI has some predictive value for the onset date of Indian monsoon, a positive SOI followed by an early onset of monsoon, and vice versa, especially if it is associated with a westerly phase of the QBO.",,,"CHATTOPADHYAY, J (corresponding author), BANARAS HINDU UNIV,DEPT GEOPHYS,VARANASI 221005,UTTAR PRADESH,INDIA.",,,"Bhatla, R/0000-0002-8031-8857",,,,,0,8,8,0,4,BIRKHAUSER VERLAG AG,BASEL,"PO BOX 133 KLOSTERBERG 23, CH-4010 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",0033-4553,,,PURE APPL GEOPHYS,Pure Appl.

The as-synthesised material was thermally dissociated at 915-degrees-C for various time spans, e.g., 1, 2 and 5 min. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results showed that the undissociated sample corresponds to the Y:124 phase, whereas the dissociated samples consisted of mixed phases. For the samples dissociated for 1 min these were Y:124 and Y:123 (with some traces of CuO), for dissociation times of 2 and 5 min these were dominantly Y:123 and CuO. From R-T and L-T (inductance-temperature) measurements, it was found that the undissociated Y:124 possesses a T(c)(R = 0) approximately 80 K and there is no drop in inductance for dissociated samples (2 and 5 min). Microstructural investigations of Y:124 revealed that the material dissociated for 1 min is biphasic, consisting of Y:124 and Y:123. Besides stacking disorder, local area superstructures along c emanating from the native Y:124 phase were also observed. This is thought to ensure from the random and sequential removal of Cu-O chains from the Y:124 structure. The sample subjected to longer dissociation times, i.e., 2 and 5 min consists of Y:123 and CuO precipitates. For longer dissociation times, e.g., 2 min and above, the Y:124 phase nearly completely converts into Y:123 and CuO.",,,"SRIVASTAVA, AK (corresponding author), BANARAS HINDU UNIV,DEPT PHYS,VARANASI 221005,UTTAR PRADESH,INDIA.",,,"Ramakrishna, Kona/0000-0002-2936-9165",,,,,11,5,5,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-4534,,,PHYSICA C,Physica C,MAR 15,1992,192,3-4,,,,,391,398,,10.1016/0921-4534(92)90845-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0921-4534(92)90845-4,,,8,"Physics, Applied; Physics, Condensed Matter",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physics,HM225,,,,,2022-12-21,WOS:A1992HM22500016,View Full Record in Web of Science

The muscarinic M2 receptor agonists, arecholine and McN-A-343, and the M2 receptor agonists, gallamine and AF-DX 116, induced a dose-related decrease in the concentrations of both 5-HT and 5-HIAA. On the contrary, scopolamine and the selective M1 receptor antagonist, pirenzepine, increased the levels of the amine and its metabolite. The anti-cholinesterase agent, physostigmine, and the putative M2 receptor agonist, carbachol, induced a dose-related dual effect, with the smaller doses decreasing and the higher doses increasing 5-HT and 5-HIAA concentrations. The results indicate that an inverse relationship exists between the cholinergic and serotonergic neurotransmitter systems in the rat brain due to the likely presence of muscarinic heteroreceptors on serotonergic neurones.

The decline in algal number was concentration dependent and metal specific at generic and species levels. Complete elimination of three and six species was observed respectively at 8.0-mu-g Cr mL-1 and 0.8-mu-g Hg mL-1 after 12 days' exposure. Likewise, a concentration-dependent and metal-specific increase in autotrophic index and pigment diversity of phytoplankton was recorded for Hg and Cr. Inhibition of C-14 uptake of phytoplankton in Ganga water was almost equal (79%) at 0.8-mu-g Hg mL-1 and 8.0-mu-g Cr mL-1 (78%). Although complete inhibition of in situ N2ase was observed at 0.8-mu-g Hg mL-1, it was only 80% with 8.0-mu-g Cr mL-1.

In this paper, we proposed a code smell prediction approach based on machine learning techniques and software metrics. The local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) algorithm was further used to explain the machine learning model's predictions and interpretability. The datasets obtained from Fontana et al. were reformed and used to build binary-label and multi-label datasets. The results of 10-fold cross-validation show that the performance of tree-based algorithms (mainly Random Forest) is higher compared with kernel-based and network-based algorithms. The genetic algorithm based feature selection methods enhance the accuracy of these machine learning algorithms by selecting the most relevant features in each dataset. Moreover, the parameter optimization techniques based on the grid search algorithm significantly enhance the accuracy of all these algorithms. Finally, machine learning techniques have high potential in predicting the code smells, which contribute to detect these smells and enhance the software's quality.","[Mhawish, Mohammad Y.; Gupta, Manjari] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Ctr Interdisciplinary Math Sci, Comp Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Mhawish, MY (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Ctr Interdisciplinary Math Sci, Comp Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",bniyaseen@gmail.com; manjari@bhu.ac.in,"gupta, Manjari/AAF-8746-2019; Mhawish, Mohammad Y./F-6575-2019","gupta, Manjari/0000-0003-1939-5383; Mhawish, Mohammad Y./0000-0001-8161-3068",,,,,71,8,9,1,4,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1000-9000,1860-4749,,J COMPUT SCI TECH-CH,J.

The imaging-based oxidative stress measurement in cyanobacteria using 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) dye has the limitation of small sample size as the only selected number of cells are analyzed to measure the ROS levels. Here, we developed a method for oxidative stress measurement by DCFH-DA and flow cytometer (FCM) using unicellular Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 and filamentous Fremyella diplosiphon BK14 cyanobacteria. F. diplosiphon BK14 inherently possess high levels of ROS and showed higher sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide treatment in comparison to S. elongatus PCC 7942. We successfully measured oxidative stress in glutaredoxin lacking strain (Delta grx3) of S. elongatus PCC 7942, and wild-type Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 using FCM based method. Importantly, ROS were not detected in these two strains of cyanobacteria by fluorescence microscope-based method due to their small spherical morphology. Delta grx3 strain showed high ROS levels in comparison to its wildtype strain. Treatment of abiotic factors such as high PAR in wild-type and Delta grx3 strains of S. elongatus PCC 7942, low PAR or low PAR + UVR in wild-type S. elongatus PCC 7942, and high PAR or high PAR + NaCl in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 increased oxidative stress. In summary, the FCM based method can measure ROS levels produced due to physiological conditions associated with genetic changes or abiotic stress in a large population of cells regardless of their morphology. Therefore, the present study shows the usefulness of the method in monitoring the health of organisms in a large scale cultivation system.","[Mondal, Soumila; Kumar, Vinod; Singh, Shailendra P.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Adv Study Bot, Inst Sci, Dept Bot, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Singh, SP (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Adv Study Bot, Inst Sci, Dept Bot, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",spsingh@bhu.ac.in,"Singh, Shailendra P./AAQ-2730-2020","Singh, Shailendra P./0000-0001-6451-7154; KUMAR, VINOD/0000-0002-0079-4870","Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), New Delhi, India [ECR/2016/000578]; SERB, New Delhi, India [ECR/2016/000578]; Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), New Delhi, India [09/013(0716)/2017-EMR-I]; University Grant Commission (UGC), New Delhi, India [F.30-370/2017]; Department of Biotechnology","Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), New Delhi, India; SERB, New Delhi, India(Department of Science & Technology (India)Science Engineering Research Board (SERB), India); Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), New Delhi, India(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India); University Grant Commission (UGC), New Delhi, India(University Grants Commission, India); Department of Biotechnology","This work was supported by the funding from Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), New Delhi, India, in the form of Early Career Research Award (ECR/2016/000578) to Shailendra P.

In the present study, we have investigated the effects of aluminum toxicity on the physiological and biochemical behavior of a hot-spring cyanobacteriumNostocsp. strain HKAR-2. The growth of cyanobacterium was declined up to 33% by increasing aluminum concentration from 0.2 to 0.6 mM at pH 7.5 as compared to control (non-treated). However, the growth had further declined up to 87 and 92% by decreasing the pH to 6.0 and 5.0, respectively, as compared to control (pH 7.5) after 12 days of treatment. The amount of protein, chlorophyll, mycosporine-like amino acids, phycobiliproteins, extracellular and intracellular macronutrients such as phosphate and nitrate contents, and nitrate reductase activity was also declined at pH 7.5 as compared to non-treated control. In addition, aluminum also altered the sodium and potassium ions in both extracellular and intracellular environments. There was an increase in the activity of antioxidative enzymes such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and ascorbic peroxidase (APX) ranging from 58, 79, and 40%, respectively, at 0.6 mM aluminum. The increase in intracellular concentration of aluminum was directly proportional to the inhibition of cyanobacterial growth at pH 7.5. In conclusion, aluminum showed acute toxicity on the hot-spring cyanobacteriumNostocsp. strain HKAR-2, which indicates that aluminum may adversely affect the microbiota of hot-spring habitats.","[Kannaujiya, Vinod K.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Bot, MMV, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Kannaujiya, Vinod K.; Kumar, Deepak; Pathak, Jainendra; Rajneesh; Sinha, Rajeshwar P.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Lab Photobiol & Mol Microbiol, Ctr Adv Study Bot, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Sinha, RP (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Lab Photobiol & Mol Microbiol, Ctr Adv Study Bot, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",r.p.sinha@gmx.net,"Kannaujiya, Vinod K./AFV-6334-2022; Sinha, Rajeshwar/CAC-2606-2022","Sinha, Rajeshwar/0000-0002-0112-6161","University Grant Commission (UGC), New Delhi, India [30-431/2018 BSR]; Department of Science and Technology, Inspire Program, New Delhi, India [DST/INSPIRE/2015/IF150191]; Council of Scientific and Industrial Research [09/013/0515/2013-EMR-I]; Department of Biotechnology, New Delhi, India [DBT-JRF/13/AL/143/2158]","University Grant Commission (UGC), New Delhi, India(University Grants Commission, India); Department of Science and Technology, Inspire Program, New Delhi, India(Department of Science & Technology (DOST), PhilippinesDepartment of Science & Technology (India)); Council of Scientific and Industrial Research(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India); Department of Biotechnology, New Delhi, India(Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India)","VKK is supported by the University Grant Commission (UGC), New Delhi, India, through Startup Research Grant (30-431/2018 BSR).

Nevertheless, pharmacological inhibition of NOX1 is a requisite approach for therapeutic utility. Recently, we have reported the anti-nociceptive effect of newly identified NOX1 specific inhibitor ML171 (2-acetylphenothiazine). Inhibition of NOX1 resulted in attenuation of nociceptive sensitization during acute inflammatory pain via inhibition of ROS generation and its downstream ERK1/2 activation. However, glial activation accompanying inflammation is closely related to the initiation and maintenance of pain. Peripheral nociceptive inputs activate the primary afferents via release of various chemical mediators which are potentially capable of mediating signals from neuron to glia in DRG and subsequently in spinal cord dorsal horn. The subsequent interactions between neuron and glia contribute to pain hypersensitivity. Thus, the present study was focused to investigate the effect of ML171 on ERK1/2 signaling, glial activation, and crosstalk between neuron and glia in a mouse model of formalin induced acute nociception. Thus, the present study was focused to investigate the effect of ML171 on ERK1/2 signaling, glial activation, and crosstalk between neuron and glia in DRG and dorsal horn of the spinal cord of lumbar region (L3-L5) in a mouse model of formalin induced acute nociception. Intraperitoneal administration of ML171 decreased nociceptive behavioral responses, i.e. the flinch and lick counts, in formalin induced nociceptive mice. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis demonstrated decreased levels of nociceptive mediators like p-ERK1/2, p-NF kappa B p65, Iba1 and GFAP in DRG as well as in spinal cord dorsal horn; supporting anti-nociceptive potential of ML171. Further, co-localization studies showed the neuron-glia crosstalk in tissue dependent manner. ERK1/2 was found to be activated in glia and NF kappa B in neurons in DRG; whereas in case of spinal cord ERK1/2 was activated in neurons and NF kappa B in astrocytes. Decrease in nociceptive behavioral response and activation of nociceptive mediators after intraperitoneal administration of ML171 strongly advocate anti-nociceptive potential of ML171. This is the first report demonstrating modulation of ERK1/2-NF kappa B signaling pathway, glial activation and regulation of neuron-glia crosstalk by NADPH oxidase1 inhibition towards its anti-nociceptive action.","[Kumar, Sanjay; Vinayak, Manjula] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Biochem & Mol Biol Lab, Dept Zool, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Vinayak, M (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Biochem & Mol Biol Lab, Dept Zool, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",sanjay3582@gmail.com; manjulavinayak@rediffmail.com,,,"DRDO, India [ERIP/ER/1003851/M/01/1336]; Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR), India; DST-FIST; UGC-UPE; UGC-CAS","DRDO, India(Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO)); Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR), India(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India); DST-FIST(Department of Science & Technology (India)); UGC-UPE(University Grants Commission, India); UGC-CAS(University Grants Commission, IndiaChinese Academy of Sciences)","Authors are thankful to DRDO, India for financial support (grant no.

Upon such genetic variations, elemental forces of evolution such as natural selection, random genetic drift and migration operate to bring about micro-evolutionary changes. Recombination or crossing-over produces new combinations of genes due to interchange of corresponding segments between nonsister chromatids of homologous chromosomes, thus, it is an important evolutionary factor. Since the time of T. H. Morgan, Drosophila has been subjected to extensive investigations on crossing over while employing a number of markers, which were used for gene mapping. Interestingly, recombination occurs in females of D. melanogaster but not in males. Later on, male crossing over was investigated in various species and its occurrence was reported in D. melanogaster, D. ananassae, D. simulans, D. willistoni, D. littoralis and D. bipectinata. Recombination occurs at very low rate in all these species except for D. ananassae, which shows spontaneous male crossing over in appreciable frequency, which is meiotic in origin. This unusual phenomenon in D. ananassae is influenced by various genetic factors as well as it shows strain variation as far as frequency of male recombination is concerned. Further, the presence of chiasmata during meiosis in males at a frequency capable of accounting for the observed recombination frequency extends evidence for meiotic origin of recombination in males of D. ananassae.","[Singh, Bashisth N.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Zool, Genet Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Singh, BN (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Zool, Genet Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",bashisthsingh2004@rediffmail.cpm,,,"UGC; CSIR; Centre of Advanced Study in Zoology, Banaras Hindu University","UGC(University Grants Commission, India); CSIR(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India); Centre of Advanced Study in Zoology, Banaras Hindu University","The work of author cited in this review has been supported by the UGC, CSIR and Centre of Advanced Study in Zoology, Banaras Hindu University.

Metal contaminated sites did show a significant reduction in microbial biomass, substrate induced respiration, fluorescein diacetate hydrolytic assay (FDAase) and beta-d-glucosidase. Concordantly, despite a high concentration of total organic carbon at these sites, CO2 emission at the land-water interface remained low. We found a strong positive correlation between CO2 emission and TOC (r = 0.92; p < 0.001). However, this relationship weakens when the sum of total heavy metal ( n-ary sumation THM) exceed 400 mu g g(-1). Also, CO2 emission did show a positive correlation (r = 0.85; p < 0.001) with FDAase. The study shows that metal accumulation in riverbed sediment could potentially lead to better carbon sequestration on account of reduced microbial/enzyme activities.

Glyoxalases (Glyl & GlyII) catalyze the conversion of toxic MG into non-toxic lactic acid but their properties and functions have been overlooked in cyanobacteria. This is the first attempt to conduct a genome-wide analysis of GlyI protein (PF00903) from Anabaena sp. PCC7120. Out of total nine Glyl domain possessing proteins, only three (A1r2321, A1r4469, A111022) harbour conserve His/Glu/His/Glu metal binding site at their homologous position and are deficient in conserved region specific for Zn2+ dependent members. Their biochemical, structural and functional characterization revealed that only Alr2321 is a homodimeric Ni2+ dependent active Glyl with catalytic efficiency 11.7 x 10(6) M-1 s(-1). It has also been found that Alr2321 is activated by various divalent metal ions and has maximum Glyl activity with Ni2+ followed by Co2+ > Mn2+ > Cu2+ and no activity with Zn2+- Moreover, the expression of alr2321 was found to be maximally up-regulated under heat (19 fold) followed by cadmium, desiccation, arsenic, salinity and UV-B stresses. BL21/pGEX-5X2-a1r2321 showed improved growth under various abiotic stresses as compared to BL21/pGEX-5X2 by increased scavenging of intracellular MG and ROS levels. Taken together, these results suggest noteworthy links between intracellular MG and ROS, its detoxification by A1r2321, a member of Glyl family of Anabaena sp.

We collected data for three consecutive years (2012-2014) along with 37 km river stretch with respect to AD-input of carbon, nutrients, and surface runoff chemistry to relate changes in the river water. We found strong linkages among carbon and nutrients in AD, surface runoff and in the river. The concentration of DOC in the river was highest in the rainy season while those of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and dissolved reactive phosphorus were highest in winter. Spatio-temporal changes in DOC indicated dependence on point- and non-point sources and within-system DOC build-up. The GPP in the river increased consistently over time and significantly correlated with AD-N (R-2 = 0.96, p < .001) and AD-P (R-2 = 0.97, p < .001). Basin level extrapolation showed that the Ganga River Basin receives 1.81 Tg organic-C, 2.77 Tg reactive-N, and 130 Gg reactive-P annually through atmospheric deposition. Non-point source contributions of carbon and nutrients to the river were substantially higher than those of point sources.

Further, rice import/export among various countries make the problem of global concern. The emergence of several reports of As in rice based food products including baby food from different parts of the world demonstrates that even the infants and toddlers are not spared.

Glyoxalases catalyze the conversion of toxic MG into non-toxic lactic acid whose properties and function are still unknown in cyanobacteria. This is the first attempt to characterize All0580 from Anabaena sp. PCC7120 as Glyll using in silico and wet lab approaches. Data of functional complementation of E. coli GlyII mutant (Delta gloB), enzyme kinetics and ESI-MS analysis suggested that All0580 harbors distinctive GlyII activity. The catalytic efficiency of All0580 (3 x 10(6) M-1 s(-1)) is higher than Arabidopsis GlyII. AAS analysis revealed the presence of a binuclear Zn/Fe centre in All0580 active site. The qRT-PCR of the target gene revealed maximum up regulation in salinity followed by drought, arsenic, heat, and UV-B stresses. BL21/pET-21a-all0580 showed 1.5 to 10 fold increased growth and up to 4 fold decreased intracellular MG level as compared to BL21/pET-21a cells under various abiotic stresses and MG. A 39% drop in ROS generation by BL21/pET-21a-all0580 under MG stress suggested its potential to manage MG toxicity. Above attributes suggest that the hypothetical protein All0580 is a novel Glyll of cyanobacteria which heterologously confers tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses in E. coli. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Their role in disease pathogenesis is also emerging. GATA4 is an important transcription factor involved in cardiac development and a wellknown candidate gene associated with congenital heart disease (CHD). In the present study, we sought to conduct molecular screening of GATA4 gene in 285 sporadic and non-syndromic CHD cases. We identified four synonymous (c.27C > A, c.822C > T, c.1233G > A and c.1263C > T) and two intronic variants (g.83217T > G & g.85012T > A) in GATA4. Extensive computational analysis using widely acceptable tools i.e., Mfold, Human Splicing Finder (HSF) and Codon Usage bias was performed with a view to understand their putative downstream effects on GATA4 function. Mfold, a mRNA structure prediction tool showed the alterations of the mRNA structure and stability due to synonymous variants. Similarly, HSF also confidently predicted effect on the cis-acting regulatory elements of splicing due to four synonymous and one donor site intronic variants. Additionally, a significant change in 'Relative Synonymous Codon usage (RSCU) frequencies' and 'log ratio of codon usage frequencies' of variant codon was also noted that might affect the rate of translation. This study establishes that the synonymous variants are possibly associated with disease phenotype in CHD patients. Comprehensive computational analysis, using well-established web based tools, is suggestive of their potential downstream molecular effects on the structure, stability and expression of GATA4 protein.","[Dixit, Ritu; Mohapatra, Bhagyalaxmi] Banaras Hindu Univ, Cytogenet Lab, Dept Zool, Inst Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Kumar, Ashok] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Pediat, Inst Med Sci, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Mohapatra, B (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Cytogenet Lab, Dept Zool, Inst Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",blaxmi2@yahoo.com,"Kumar, Ashok/AAX-3875-2020","Kumar, Ashok/0000-0003-2054-8463","Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science & Technology, New Delhi, India [No-BT/PR14501/MED/12/479/2010]","Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science & Technology, New Delhi, India","This study was financially supported by the Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science & Technology, New Delhi, India (Project No-BT/PR14501/MED/12/479/2010).

Eiger, the sole homologue of TNF in Drosophila, initiates the TNF-JNK pathway to induce cell death. Previously, Deltex (Dx) has been identified as a Notch signaling component that regulates vesicular trafficking of Notch. In the present study, we have investigated the interaction between these two proteins in order to identify how Dx influences the activity of Eiger. Dx is found to act as a novel modulator of JNK-mediated cell death inducing activity of Eiger. Additionally, we observe that dx genetically interacts with eiger during wing development, and these two proteins, Dx and Eiger, colocalize in the cytoplasm. Our analysis reveals that Dx is involved in the cytoplasmic relocalization of Eiger from the cell membrane, thereby influencing Eiger-mediated JNK-activation process. Moreover, we demonstrate that Dx potentiates the activity of Eiger to downregulate Notch signaling pathway by retaining the Notch protein in the cytoplasm. Together, our findings reveal a novel role of Dx to modulate the signaling activity of Eiger and subsequent JNK-mediated cell death.","[Dutta, Debdeep; Singh, Ankita; Paul, Maimuna Sali; Sharma, Vartika; Mutsuddi, Mousumi; Mukherjee, Ashim] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Mutsuddi, M; Mukherjee, A (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",mousumi_mutsuddi@yahoo.com; ashim04@gmail.com,"Dutta, Debdeep/R-5905-2019; Sharma, Vartika/AGM-8959-2022","Dutta, Debdeep/0000-0003-0989-7013; Sharma, Vartika/0000-0001-6642-4277","Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Government of India; University Grant Commission, Government of India","Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Government of India(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India); University Grant Commission, Government of India(University Grants Commission, India)","We acknowledge Bloomington Stock Centre and Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa for fly stocks and antibodies.

The precise pathogenetic changes that trigger the development of AD remain largely unknown. Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms in multiple genes which are associated with AD; most notably, these are ABCA7, bridging integrator 1(B1N1), triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), CD33, clusterin (CLU), complement receptor 1 (CRI), ephrin type-A receptor 1 (EPHA1), membrane-spanning 4-domains, subfamily A (MS4A) and phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM) genes. The proteins coded by the candidate genes participate in a variety of cellular processes such as oxidative balance, protein metabolism, cholesterol metabolism and synaptic function. This review summarizes the major gene loci affecting LOAD identified by large GWASs. Tentative mechanisms have also been elaborated in various studies by which the proteins coded by these genes may exert a role in AD pathogenesis have also been elaborated. The review suggests that these may together affect LOAD pathogenesis in a complementary fashion.","[Misra, Anamika; Chakrabarti, Sankha Shubhra; Gambhir, Indrajeet Singh] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Med, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Gambhir, IS (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Med, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",gambhir.alzheimers@gmail.com,"Chakrabarti, Sankha Shubhra/L-3407-2019; misra, anamika/AAZ-1036-2020; Chakrabarti, Sankha Shubhra/K-6933-2019","Chakrabarti, Sankha Shubhra/0000-0001-7737-0016; Chakrabarti, Sankha Shubhra/0000-0001-7737-0016; Misra, Anamika/0000-0003-3551-0011",,,,,94,19,21,0,6,WOLTERS KLUWER MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS,MUMBAI,"WOLTERS KLUWER INDIA PVT LTD , A-202, 2ND FLR, QUBE, C T S  NO 1498A-2 VILLAGE MAROL, ANDHERI EAST, MUMBAI, 400059, INDIA",0971-5916,,,INDIAN J MED RES,Indian J.

The molecular and cellular changes associated with meiotic cell cycle progression from M-I to M-II stage and extrusion of PB-I remain ill understood. Several factors drive oocyte meiosis from M-I to M-II stage. The mitogen-activated protein kinase3/1 (MAPK3/1), signal molecules and Rho family GTPases act through various pathways to drive cell cycle progression from M-I to M-II stage. The down regulation of MOS/MEK/MAPK3/1 pathway results in the activation of anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). The active APC/C destabilizes maturation promoting factor (MPF) and induces meiotic resumption. Several signal molecules such as, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK2), SENP3, mitotic kinesin-like protein 2 (MKlp2), regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS2), Epsin2, polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) are directly or indirectly involved in chromosomal segregation. Rho family GTPase is another enzyme that along with cell division cycle (Cdc42) to form actomyosin contractile ring required for chromosomal segregation. In the presence of origin recognition complex (ORC4), eccentrically localized haploid set of chromosomes trigger cortex differentiation and determine the division site for polar body formation. The actomyosin contractile activity at the site of division plane helps to form cytokinetic furrow that results in the formation and extrusion of PB-I. Indeed, oocyte journey from M-I to M-II stage is coordinated by several factors and pathways that enable oocyte to extrude PB-I. Quality of oocyte directly impact fertilization rate, early embryonic development, and reproductive outcome in mammals.","[Sharma, Alka; Tiwari, Meenakshi; Gupta, Anumegha; Pandey, Ashutosh N.; Yadav, Pramod K.; Chaube, Shail K.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Cell Physiol Lab, Dept Zool, Inst Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Chaube, SK (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Cell Physiol Lab, Dept Zool, Inst Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",shailchaubey@gmail.com,"Chaube, Shail K/O-3558-2019; Chaube, Shail/ABC-1337-2020; Yadav, Pramod Kumar/T-4849-2019","Yadav, Pramod Kumar/0000-0003-0406-5701; /0000-0002-1348-4273","Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India [EMR/2014/000702]","Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India(Department of Science & Technology (India))","Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India, Grant number: EMR/2014/000702",,94,9,9,0,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9541,1097-4652,,J CELL PHYSIOL,J.

The surface of the epidermis is covered with polygonal epithelial cells, each having surface relief of microridges forming intricate patterns. In between epithelial cells irregularly distributed mucous cell openings, randomly distributed epidermal specialized structures, taste buds, and neuromasts are discernible. The epidermal specialized structures are keratinized. These are either irregularly the rounded elevated plaque like or the cone shaped structures. The superficial keratinized cells could frequently be discernible exfoliated at the surface. At intervals, characteristic epidermal projections could be observed. Surface of these projections at intervals is differentiated into short stumpy protuberances, each bearing a taste bud at its summit.

The experiment was laid out in three times replicated split plot design, where main-plots received four wheat + Indian mustard intercropping row proportions (8:1, 6:2, 8:2 10:2) and sub-plots got four levels of the combined application of farmyard manure (15 and 30% N) and fertilizer (75 and 100% recommended doses of fertilizer) applied on area basis. The productivity of wheat and mustard in wheat + mustard intercropping in terms of yield parameters, viz. grains/spike, spikelets/spike, 1,000-grain weight and seed yield as well as straw yield in wheat, and siliquae/plant and seeds/siliqua of Indian mustard, were significantly higher with row proportion of 8:1 over 10:2, 8:2 and 6:2. However, seed yield and stover yield of Indian mustard was higher in 6: 2 row proportion which was at par with 8:2 and 10:2 row proportions. Wheat + Indian mustard intercropping under 10:2 row proportion proved more remunerative and recorded higher yield advantage than 8:1, 8:2 and 6:2 row proportions as judged by total land equivalent ratio, monetary advantage, net return and benefit: cost ratio. The aggressivity was higher for Indian mustard than wheat. Application of 15% or 30% N through FYM + 100% recommended doses of fertilizer (RDF) significantly enhanced yield attributes and yield of wheat and Indian mustard. The highest total land equivalent ratio and aggressivity of Indian mustard indicated superiority of the application of 30% N through FYM + 100% RDF.

In the present study, we demonstrate that Trichoderma asperellum T42 mediate enhancement in host biomass, total nitrogen content, nitric oxide (NO) production and cytosolic Ca2+ accumulation in tobacco. T42 inoculation enhanced lateral root, root hair length, root hair density and root/shoot dry mass in tobacco under deprived nutrients condition. Interestingly, these growth attributes were further elevated in presence of T42 and supplementation of NO3- and NH4- nutrients to tobacco at 40 and 70 days, particularly in NO3- supplementation, whereas no significant increment was observed in nia30 mutant. In addition, NO production was more in tobacco roots in T42 inoculated plants fed with NO3- nutrient confirming NO generation was dependent on NR pathway. NO3- dependent NO production contributed to increase in lateral root initiation, Ca2+ accumulation and activities of nitrate transporters (NRTs) in tobacco. Higher activities of several NRT genes in response to T42 and N nutrients and suppression of ammonium transporter (AMT1) suggested that induction of high affinity NRTs help NO3 acquisition through roots of tobacco. Among the NRTs NRT2.1 and NRT2.2 were more upregulated compared to the other NRTs. Addition of sodium nitroprusside (SNP), relative to those supplied with NO3-/NH4+ nutrition and T42 treated plants singly, and with application of NO inhibitor, cPTIO, confirmed the altered NO fluorescence intensity in tobacco roots. Our findings suggest that T42 promoted plant growth significantly ant N content in the tobacco plants grown under N nutrients, notably higher in NO3-, providing insight of the strategy for not only tobacco but probably for other crops as well to adapt to fluctuating nitrate availability in soil.","[Singh, Bansh N.; Singh, Gopal S.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Singh, Bansh N.; Dwivedi, Padmanabh] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Agr Sci, Dept Plant Physiol, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Sarma, Birinchi K.; Singh, Hrishikesh B.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Agr Sci, Dept Mycol & Plant Pathol, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Dwivedi, P (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Agr Sci, Dept Plant Physiol, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India.",pdwivedi25@rediffmail.com,"Dwivedi, Padmanabh/L-5307-2019; Sarma, Birinchi Kumar/ABE-5555-2020; Dwivedi, Padmanabh/AAJ-8808-2020; Sarma, Birinchi Kumar/GPX-1633-2022","Sarma, Birinchi Kumar/0000-0002-1041-8422; Sarma, Birinchi Kumar/0000-0002-1041-8422","SERB-DST, Government of India, New Delhi [SR/SO/PS-23/10(G)]","SERB-DST, Government of India, New Delhi","We thank Professor W.

MWCNTs-Mn(III)salen coated on glassy carbon electrode (GC), represented as GC/MWCNTs-Mn(III)salen exhibits high sensitivity and low detection limit. This electrode demonstrates high reproducibility (R.S.D. = 3.7% and 3.4% for vitamin B-2 and B-6, respectively) and long storage stability (more than 10 days under normal room temperature condition). Methodologies for the analysis of vitamins B-2 and B-6 using GC/MWCNTs-Mn(III)salen in pharmaceutical formulations using simple electrochemical techniques are elucidated.","[Sonkar, Piyush Kumar; Ganesan, Vellaichamy; Sen Gupta, Susanta K.; Yadav, Dharmendra Kumar; Gupta, Rupali; Yadav, Mamta] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Chem, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Sonkar, Piyush Kumar] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Chem, MMV, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Ganesan, V (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Chem, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",vlegan@bhu.ac.in,"Yadav, Dharmendra Kumar/L-1846-2015; Ganesan, Vellaichamy/C-7529-2012","Yadav, Dharmendra Kumar/0000-0003-1102-1993; Ganesan, Vellaichamy/0000-0002-5241-5350","DST, New Delhi, India","DST, New Delhi, India(Department of Science & Technology (India))","The authors acknowledge the funding by DST (SR/NM/NS-2012/2013(G)), New Delhi, India.

The polymeric film of L-methionine was electrochemically deposited on gold-coated EQCM electrode. Experimental parameters were optimized for controlling the performance of molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP)-modified sensor such as ratio of monomer and template, number of electropolymerization cycles, mass deposited in each cycle, and pH. Thus, fabricated MIP-EQCM sensor was successfully applied for estimation of taurine in solutions with varying matrices, such as aqueous, human blood plasma, milk from cow, buffalo, and milk powder. Under optimized parameters, response of MIP sensor to taurine was linearly proportional to its concentration with limit of detection as 0.12 mu M. Hence, a highly sensitive and selective piezoelectric sensor for taurine has been reported here via imprinting approach.","[Singh, Ambareesh Kumar; Singh, Meenakshi] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Chem, MMV, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Singh, M (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Chem, MMV, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",meenakshi@bhu.ac.in,"Singh, Meenakshi/I-6855-2013","Singh, Meenakshi/0000-0002-5909-8757",Council of Scientific and Industrial Research [01(2769)/13/EMR-II],Council of Scientific and Industrial Research(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India),"Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Grant/Award Number: 01(2769)/13/EMR-II",,38,5,5,1,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0952-3499,1099-1352,,J MOL RECOGNIT,J.

In the present study, we examined whether a gap junction blocker, carbenoxolone (CBX) could induce EDA by reducing cyclic nucleotides level and destabilizing maturation promoting factor (MPF) in rat oocytes cultured in vitro. Methods: Diplotene-arrested cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) were collected from ovary of immature female rats after 20 IU pregnant mare's serum gonadotropins (PMSG) for 48 h. These diplotene-arrested COCs were incubated with various concentration of CBX for 3 h in vitro. The morphological changes, meiotic status of oocyte, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), total nitric oxide (NO), adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP), cell division cycle 25 B (Cdc25B), changes in specific phosphorylation status of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) and cyclin B1 levels were analyzed. Results: CBX induced EDA in a concentration-dependent manner. The iNOS expression, total NO and cyclic nucleotides level were significantly decreased. The reduced cyclic nucleotides level resulted in the decrease of Cdc25B expression level. The decreased Cdc25B was associated with the increased Thr14/Tyr15 phosphorylated Cdk1 level. However, Thr161 phosphorylated Cdk1 as well as cyclin B1 levels were significantly reduced leading to MPF destabilization. The destabilized MPF finally induced EDA in rat COCs cultured in vitro. Conclusions: Our results suggest that CBX blocked gap junctions interrupted the transfer of cyclic nucleotides to the oocyte. Reduction of cyclic nucleotides level destabilized MPF and induced EDA in vitro. Thus, CBX could be used to induce meiotic maturation under in vitro culture conditions during assisted reproductive technology (ART) programs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The values of bioconcentration factor and translocation factor calculated on the basis of total As-accumulation in roots and shoots suggested that A. annua is a good As-accumulator. Above and below ground plant biomass was enhanced at 100 mu M As but at 150 mu M As was significantly reduced. As-treatment caused membrane damage more in the roots than in the leaves as reflected by higher degree of lipid peroxidation in the roots than in the leaves. In response to As stress, plants activated antioxidative defense for detoxification of induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), As sequestration via phytochelatins (PCS) as well as production of a wide range of secondary metabolites. All of them were activated differently in roots and leaves. Among enzymatic antioxidants, leaves significantly elevated superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione reductase, whereas in roots SOD, catalase, and peroxidase played significant role in ROS detoxification. Plants activated As-sequestration pathway through thiols, glutathione, and PCS and their respective genes were more induced in leaves than in roots. Further gas chromatography in tandem with mass spectroscopy analysis revealed differential modulation of secondary metabolites in leaves and roots to sustain As-stress. For example, roots synthesized linoleic acid (4.85 %) under As-treatment that probably stimulated stress-signalling pathways and in turn activated differential defense mechanisms in roots to cope up with the adverse effects of As.","[Kumari, A.; Pandey, N.; Pandey-Rai, S.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Bot, Lab Morphogenesis, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Pandey-Rai, S (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Bot, Lab Morphogenesis, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",shashi.bhubotany@gmail.com,"Pandey, Neha/AAF-3272-2020; Pandey-Rai, Shashi/E-6536-2010","Pandey-Rai, Shashi/0000-0002-6998-1594; Pandey, Neha/0000-0001-5924-2168",Council of Scientific and Industrial Research [CSIR-P-25/329],Council of Scientific and Industrial Research(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India),"The authors are thankful to the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR-P-25/329) for financial support to carry this work.

Studies involving use of ethylenediurea (EDU), a chemical with antiozonant properties, have given some promising results in evaluating O-3 injury in plants. The use of EDU is especially advantageous in developing countries which face a more severe problem of ground-level O-3, and technical O-3-induced yield loss assessment techniques like open-top chambers cannot be used. Recent studies have detected a hormetic response of EDU on plants; i.e. treatment with higher EDU concentrations may or may not show any adverse effect on plants depending upon the experimental conditions. Although the mode of action of EDU is still debated, it is confirmed that EDU remains confined in the apoplastic regions. Certain studies indicate that EDU significantly affects the electron transport chain and has positive impact on the antioxidant defence machinery of the plants. However, the mechanism of protecting the yield of plants without significantly affecting photosynthesis is still questionable. This review discusses in details the probable mode of action of EDU on the basis of available data along with the impact of EDU on physiological, biochemical, growth and yield response of plants under O-3 stress. Data regarding the effect of EDU on plant 'omics' is highly insufficient and can form an important aspect of future EDU research.","[Tiwari, Supriya] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Bot, Varanasi 221005, UP, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Tiwari, S (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Bot, Varanasi 221005, UP, India.",supriyabhu@gmail.com,,,,,,,177,14,16,0,25,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

The testis treated with tamoxifen, in vivo or in vitro, showed dose-dependent regressive changes in spermatogenesis. This study showed that the decreased estrogenic effect due to tamoxifen may be directly responsible for decreased testicular expression of aromatase, which in turn may be responsible for decreased synthesis of estradiol in the testis. The decreased endogenous estradiol through cAMP-CREB signaling mechanism may decline germ cells proliferation (PCNA) and survival (Bc12). The tamoxifen-induced decreased estrogenic effect may also be responsible for increased expression of testicular NOS and consequently increased production of NO, which may cause increased germ cells apoptosis (Caspase-3) and impaired spermatogenesis. Both in vivo and in vitro studies showed the inhibitory effect on testicular steroidogenic factors. Thus, tamoxifen inhibits testicular spermatogenesis and steroidogenesis either directly acting on testis or indirectly through gonadotropin release. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The variations in PBPs and PP were monitored by alternating light and dark under PAR, UV-B, and PAR + UV-B radiations over a period of 25 h. There was a decline in the amount of Chl a and PBPs during light periods of UV-B and PAR + UV-B and an increase during dark periods showing a circadian rhythm by destruction and resynthesis of pigment-protein complex. However, a marked induction in carotenoids was recorded during light periods of the same radiations. Moreover, the ratio of Chl a/PE and Chl a/PC was increased in dark periods showing the resynthesis of bleached Chl a. The wavelength shift in emission fluorescence of PBPs toward shorter wavelengths further indicated the bleaching and destruction of PBPs during light periods. Oxidative damage upon exposure to PAR, UV-B, and PAR + UV-B was alleviated by induction of antioxidative enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX). The studied cyanobacterium exhibits a significant increase in the activities of SOD, CAT, and APX upon exposure to UV-B and PAR + UV-B radiations. The results indicate that pigment-protein composition of Nostoc sp. stain HKAR-2 was significantly altered during diurnal variation of light/radiation, which might play an important role in optimization for their productivity in a particular cyanobacterium.","[Kannaujiya, Vinod K.; Sinha, Rajeshwar P.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Adv Study Bot, Lab Photobiol & Mol Microbiol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Sinha, RP (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Adv Study Bot, Lab Photobiol & Mol Microbiol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",r.p.sinha@gmx.net,"Sinha, Rajeshwar/CAC-2606-2022; Kannaujiya, Vinod K./AFV-6334-2022","Sinha, Rajeshwar/0000-0002-0112-6161; ","Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), New Delhi, India [09/013(0258)/2009-EMR-I]","Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), New Delhi, India(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India)","VK Kannaujiya is thankful to the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), New Delhi, India (09/013(0258)/2009-EMR-I), for the financial assistance in the form of senior research fellowship.",,56,11,11,2,5,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0033-183X,1615-6102,,PROTOPLASMA,Protoplasma,JAN,2017,254,1,,,,,423,433,,10.1007/s00709-016-0964-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00709-016-0964-0,,,11,Plant Sciences; Cell Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences; Cell Biology,EH9YG,27026262,,,,2022-12-21,WOS:000392127400036,View Full Record in Web of Science

The structural properties of the complex were evaluated using XRD and formation of complex was verified by FT-IR technique. The absorption, excitation and photoluminescence properties of the Tb3+ ion get improved when complexed with ASA and Phen ligands. Selective excitations of Tb3+, ASA and Phen revealed an efficient energy transfer enhancing green luminescence of Tb3+ ion on excitation with 355, 335 and 306 nm radiations respectively. The emission intensity arising from Tb (ASA)(3)Phen complex in PVA has been observed to be much more as compared to the one with Tb3+ ions only. The fluorescence decay time for Tb3+ (D-5(4) -> F-7(5) transition) is seen to increase from 557 mu s in Tb3+ to 628 mu s in presence of Tb(ASA)(3)Phen complex. The fluorescence decay time for Phen and ASA is seen to decrease from 4.43 ns to 1.64 ns and from 5.75 ns to 1.58 ns respectively in Tb(ASA)(3)Phen complex. This reflects an energy transfer from excited Phen to ASA and finally to Tb3+ is proposed as the cause of the above observations and thus an energy avalanche. The intense green luminescence on 266 nm excitation in Tb(ASA)(3)Phen complex in PVA with quantum yield of 0.32 shows a tendency towards lasing. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Hyperactivation of AKT signaling is frequent in cancer, which maintains a high oxidative state in a tumor microenvironment that is needed for tumor adaptation. Therefore, antioxidants are proposed to exhibit anticancer properties by interfering with the tumor microenvironment. Quercetin is an ubiquitous bioactive antioxidant rich in vegetables and beverages. The present study aimed to analyze cancer preventive property of quercetin in ascite cells of Dalton's lymphoma-bearing mice. Protein level was determined by Western blotting. Nitric oxide (NO) level was estimated spectrophotometrically using Griess reagent. Results show downregulation in phosphorylation of AKT and PDK1 by quercetin, which was consistent with decreased phosphorylation of downstream survival factors such as BAD, GSK-3 beta, mTOR, and IkBa. Further, quercetin attenuated the levels of angiogenic factor VEGF-A and inflammatory enzymes COX-2 and iNOS as well as NO levels, whereas it increased the levels of phosphatase PTEN. Overall results suggest that quercetin modulates AKT signaling leading to attenuation of cell survival, inflammation, and angiogenesis in lymphoma-bearing mice.","[Maurya, Akhilendra Kumar; Vinayak, Manjula] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Ctr Adv Study Zool, Lab Biochem & Mol Biol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Vinayak, M (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Ctr Adv Study Zool, Lab Biochem & Mol Biol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",manjulavinayak@rediffmail.com,,"Maurya, Akhilendra Kumar/0000-0001-5107-9546","University Grants Commission (UGC), India; CSIR, India","University Grants Commission (UGC), India(University Grants Commission, India); CSIR, India(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India)","Research was supported by University Grants Commission (UGC), India.

Significant variability was found among the accessions for all the traits. High heritability coupled with high genetic advance was observed for lesion mimic. All the 52 lines were grouped into 8 clusters based on the genetic divergence. Maximum diversity was assessed between Cluster III and VI whereas maximum intra-cluster distance was found in the cluster I and in cluster VIII suggesting that member of these clusters can be utilised in hybridization breeding programmes. The first two principal components (PCI and PCII) cumulatively explained a major portion of total variability (46.52%). Spike length and lesion mimic in PC1 showed highest positive weights. Days to heading, biomass and plant height in PCII were the characters possessing highest positive weights.

True histopathological portal vein invasion is found only in a small subset of such patients. The aim of this review aimed to discuss the significance of histopathological venous invasion in PDAC. DATA SOURCES: For this review available data was searched from PubMed and analyzed. No randomized trials have been published on this topic. RESULTS: Existing data on prognostic factors in histopathological venous invasion by PDAC are limited and recent studies indicate worse survival in this subgroup of patients. In addition, venous invasion in PDAC has been associated with large tumors, involved lymph nodes, perineural invasion and RI resection. The survival of patients with portal venous resection but without histologic venous invasion is reportedly better than those with histopathological venous invasion; though conflicting studies do exist on the subject. Some studies also relate the depth of venous invasion to prognosis after surgical resection of PDAC. CONCLUSIONS: Frankl'histopathological' invasion of superior mesenteric/portal venous and RI resection indicate a very poor survival.

It imposes serious long-term costs on the individual as well as health and social systems. Hence, developing therapies that prevent the long-term consequences of early life stress is of utmost importance, and necessitates a better understanding of the mechanisms by which early life stress triggers long-lasting alterations in gene expression and behavior. Post-weaning isolation rearing of rodents models the behavioral consequences of adverse early life experiences in humans and it is reported to cause anxiety like behavior which is more common in case of females. Therefore, in the present study, we have studied the impact of social isolation of young female mice for 8 weeks on the anxiety like behavior and the underlying molecular mechanism. Elevated plus maze and open field test revealed that social isolation caused anxiety like behavior. BDNF, a well-known molecule implicated in the anxiety like behavior, was up-regulated both at the message and protein level in cerebral cortex by social isolation. CREB-1 and CBP, which play a crucial role in BDNF transcription, were up regulated at mRNA level in cerebral cortex by social isolation. HDAC-2, which negatively regulates BDNF expression, was down-regulated at mRNA and protein level in cerebral cortex by social isolation. Furthermore, BDNF acts in concert with Limk-1, miRNA-132 and miRNA-134 for the regulation of structural and morphological plasticity. Social isolation resulted in up-regulation of Limk-1 mRNA and miRNA-132 expression in the cerebral cortex. MiRNA-134, which inhibits the translation of Limk-1, was decreased in cerebral cortex by social isolation. Taken together, our study suggests that social isolation mediated anxiety like behavior is associated with up regulation of BDNF expression and concomitant increase in the expression of CBP, CREB-1, Limk-1 and miRNA-132, and decrease in the expression of HDAC-2 and miRNA-134 in the cerebral cortex.

For this purpose, ROS and H2O2 levels, mitochondria distribution and its membrane potential, p286-CaMK-II, Emi2, Thr-161 phophorylated cyclin-dependent protein kinase1 (Cdk1) as well as cyclin B1 levels, in vitro effects of 3-tert-butyl-4 hydroxy anisole (BHA), pentoxifylline and dibutyryl-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (db-cAMP) were analyzed during postovulatory aging-induced abortive SEA in vitro. Data of the present study suggest that postovulatory aging increased H2O2 levels, disturbed mitochondrial distribution pattern and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in eggs. There was an significant increase of p286-CaMK-II level, while Emi2 level reduced significantly during egg aging in vitro. The reduced Emi2 level was associated with decreased Thr-161 phosphorylated cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (Cdk1) as well as cyclin B1 level in aged eggs that underwent abortive SEA. Further, supplementation of pentoxifylline, db-cAMP, and BHA protected postovulatory aging-mediated abortive SEA in concentration-dependent manner. These data suggest that postovulatory aging increased H2O2 levels, reduced MMP, and increased p286-CaMK-II. The increased p286-CaMK-II was associated with reduced Emi2 level and maturation-promoting factor levels during postovulatory aging-mediated abortive SEA. Drugs that elevate cAMP directly or indirectly and BHA protected postovulatory aging-mediated abortive SEA possibly by reducing ROS level in rat eggs cultured in vitro.","[Premkumar, Karuppanan V.; Chaube, Shail K.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Ctr Adv Study, Cell Physiol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Chaube, SK (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Ctr Adv Study, Cell Physiol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",shailchaubey@gmail.com,"Chaube, Shail/ABC-1337-2020; Chaube, Shail K/O-3558-2019",,"Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India","Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India(Department of Biotechnology (DBT) IndiaMinistry of Science and Technology, Government of India)","This study was financially supported by Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India.",,50,21,21,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1071-2690,1543-706X,,IN VITRO CELL DEV-AN,In Vitro Cell.

In this system, newly synthesized amphiphilic potassium N-methylN-dodecyldithiocarbamate (MeDTC) was doped in 4-cyano-41-pentyl biphenyl (5CB) LC, which align LC molecules at aqueous interface and polar head group of the amphiphile acts as mecuric ion specific chelating ligand. When this sensor system was incubated in the aqueous solution containing Hg2+ ions, a dark to bright transition of the image of LCs was observed. This was caused due to rapid and stable complex formation between dithiocarbamate chelating group of MeDTC with Hg2+ ions at aqueous interface, which disrupted the orientation of LCs giving bright texture. The limit of detection of the system for aqueous Hg2+ ion is 0.5 M. This sensor did not respond to other metal ions like Pb2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, Na2+, Mg2+ and Ca2+, which are common environmental interference in water. We also demonstrated that this sensor is capable of detecting Hg2+ ions in real water samples (tap water). The very simple and effective procedure reported here should facilitate the development of real time, portable and reliable LC based sensor for mercury pollution control. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we have investigated the effect of autologous Hsp70-peptide complex (or simply autologous Hsp70) on the expression of CD28 on T cells and its effector functions through macrophage activation. Further, we investigated the effect of Hsp70 on the expression of CD80 and CD86 on macrophages isolated from normal and tumor-bearing host to provide costimulatory signal for T cell activation and secretion of IL-2 and IFN-gamma during interaction. We found that treatment of autologous Hsp70 effectively activated TAMs to induce higher expression of CD28 on T cells through T cells-macrophage interaction. Treatment of autologous Hsp70 induces higher expression of CD80 and CD86 on TAMs, as a result, increases B7/CD28 interaction, which in turns activates T cells and induces higher production of IL-2 and IFN-gamma, thereby increasing antigen-specific T cell proliferation. With our novel study, we have provided the strong insights into the role of extracellular Hsp70 on the expression of CD28 costimulatory molecule on T cells, which helps in the activation and generation of antigen-specific T cell effector functions in a tumor-bearing host to curb malignancy.","[Kumar, Sanjay; Gautam, Pramod Kumar; Tomar, Munendra Singh; Acharya, Arbind] Banaras Hindu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Ctr Adv Study, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Kumar, S (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Ctr Adv Study, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",sanjayku15@yahoo.co.in,"Tomar, Munendra/HGB-9710-2022; Acharya, Arbind/AAN-2551-2021","Acharya, Arbind/0000-0002-7621-9477; /0000-0002-9792-5936; GAUTAM, Dr. PRAMOD KUMAR/0000-0001-7580-8846","UGC, New Delhi","UGC, New Delhi(University Grants Commission, India)","We are grateful to UGC, New Delhi, for the financial support to SK as a postdoctoral research work.",,36,1,1,0,2,HUMANA PRESS INC,TOTOWA,"999 RIVERVIEW DRIVE SUITE 208, TOTOWA, NJ 07512 USA",0257-277X,1559-0755,,IMMUNOL RES,Immunol.

The structural flexibility of Tat protein is one of the unique features, responsible for the diverse functions. The RNA binding ability and interacting domains are very important characteristic of the HIV-Tat protein. HIV Tat protein adversely affects the integrity of the blood brain barrier by a variety of mechanisms.

The role of vagally mediated anti-inflammatory pathway in ARDS is poorly understood. Therefore, the effects of vagal efferent stimulation on these two models of ARDS were examined. Experiments were performed on anesthetized adult rats. Parameters like ventilatory changes (respiratory frequency and minute ventilation), hypoxemic status (PaO2/FiO(2) ratio; P/F ratio), survival time, pulmonary water content and histopathological evidences of lung injury were determined to assess the severity of ARDS. In addition, heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were monitored. Injection of OA/MBT venom produced respiratory alterations, hypoxemia, pulmonary edema and histopathological changes demonstrating the development of ARDS. In both the groups, animals died around 60 min. Tachypnea and hyperventilation were seen after OA while bradypnea and hypoventilation were seen after MBT venom. Pulmonary edema was absent in vagotomised animals in MBT venom group but not in OA group. Further, electrical stimulation of the cut peripheral ends of vagii prolonged the survival time and attenuated all the parameters of MBT venom-induced ARDS significantly. In case of OA, there was improvement in histopathological changes but the survival time of animals was not prolonged.

Our findings indicated crucial involvement of these proteases in prenatal and postnatal development of mouse cerebral cortex. However, the mechanisms that precisely control their expression in stage-specific manner during brain development are still elusive. In this regard, epigenetic modifications by DNA methylation and histone acetylation during brain development deserve major attention. Therefore, we have analyzed the epigenetic regulation of PS1 and PS2 in mouse cerebral cortex during development. The data demonstrated a good correspondence of H3K9/14 Ac level in PS1 and PS2 promoter with their expression profile during cerebral cortical development. H3K9/14 Ac level was high at embryonic day (E)12.5, declined at E18.5, increased from postnatal day (P)0 to P45 and decreased again at 20 weeks (w) in PS1 promoter. For PS2, H3K9/14 Ac level was high at E12.5, thereafter, reduced upto P20 and increased at P45 and 20 weeks. DNA methylation sites also varied in number and position at different developmental stages, and some of them are putative sites for binding of transcription factors like HSF-1, Ets-1, and Sp1 that are crucial for brain developmental processes, as revealed by in silico analysis. Though MeCP2 level also altered during development, they did not correlate with PS1 and PS2 expression profile. Taken together, our findings provide the first evidence of epigenetic regulation of PS1 and PS2 by H3K9/14 histone acetylation and DNA methylation in mouse cerebral cortex during development.

Materials and Methods: BALB/c (H (2d) ) mice at 8-10 weeks of age of either sex were used. Increasing concentration of CHE (1.25, 2.5, and 5.0 mg/kg), staurosporine (0.625, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mg/kg) and cyclophosphamide (25, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally and tumor regression and survival duration of tumor bearing host were determined, and thereafter expression of NKG2D and NKG2A on TANK cells were detected. Results: Our results show that treatment with 2.5 mg/kg of CHE results in a significant reduction in mean tumor volume and increased survival duration of DL bearing BALB/c (H (2d) ) mice when compared to control. Activating receptor NKG2D on TANK cells were observed upregulated in contrast to inhibitory receptor NKG2A. Conclusions: CHE reduced mean tumor volume and increased survival duration of DL bearing BALB/c (H (2d) ) mice. Increased expression of activating receptor NKG2D on TANK cells results in recovery of immunosuppression during tumor progression. Therefore, CHE could be a potential anticancer therapeutic agent that may be used to replace chemo-radio-therapy in future.","[Kumar, Sanjay; Tomar, Munendra Singh; Acharya, Arbind] Banaras Hindu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Acharya, A (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",acharya@bhu.ac.in,"Acharya, Arbind/AAN-2551-2021; Tomar, Munendra/HGB-9710-2022","Acharya, Arbind/0000-0002-7621-9477; /0000-0002-9792-5936","University Grants Commission (UGC), New Delhi","University Grants Commission (UGC), New Delhi(University Grants Commission, India)","The project was supported by University Grants Commission (UGC), New Delhi.

Moreover, the intensity of jarosite peaks has been noticed to increase after the bacterial treatment. The FTIR spectra of the bacterial treated Rajmahal coal samples indicate shifting of the absorption peaks as compared to the control samples. The oxidation of pyrite due to the bacterial action and its conversion into jarosite is indicated by the stretching of OH bond at 630 cm(-1) peak.

We assessed the temporal dynamics of microbial biomass and selected soil enzymes (beta-d-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, polyphenol oxidase, urease, glycine-aminopeptidase and alkaline phosphatase) during wheat cultivation, under four different tillage practices in the rice-wheat system. The four practices involved conventional tilling of soil before cultivating each crop (CTR-CTW); no tilling before cultivating rice but conventional tillage before wheat (NTR-CTW); conventional tilling before cultivating rice but no tilling before wheat (CTR-NTW) and no tilling before cultivation of each crop (NTR-NTW). Microbial biomass and activities of hydrolytic enzymes increased under NTR-NTW followed by CTR-NTW and NTR-CTW with respect to the conventional practice CTR-CTW, thus reflecting improvement in microbial activities with reduced tillage frequency. Enzyme activities generally depended on soil moisture and temperature, but nature of relationships varied among different practices. Nutrient demand appeared to be the strongest driver of alkaline phosphatase and urease, and soil temperature for glycine-aminopeptidase. Under CTR-CTW, activities of most of the extracellular enzymes were related with beta-d-glucosidase or urease, but such relations altered under rest of the practices. The study showed that extracellular soil enzymes respond sensitively to tillage practices as well as environmental variables, particularly soil temperature and moisture and hence can serve as a sensitive indicator of changes in soil processes. Considering improvement in microbial biomass and enzymatic activities as indicators of better soil quality, adoption of no tillage apparently improved soil quality. Still, more number of field studies are required under tillage managements to explore the relationships between different enzyme activities and environmental factors.","[Pandey, Divya; Agrawal, Madhoolika] Banaras Hindu Univ, Lab Air Pollut & Global Climate Change, Dept Bot, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Bohra, Jitendra Singh] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Agr Sci, Dept Agron, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Agrawal, M (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Lab Air Pollut & Global Climate Change, Dept Bot, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",madhoo.agrawal@gmail.com,"Pandey, Divya/AAA-5928-2019","Pandey, Divya/0000-0001-8626-1647","University Grants Commission (UGC), New Delhi through research project","University Grants Commission (UGC), New Delhi through research project","Authors acknowledge University Grants Commission (UGC), New Delhi, for financial support through research project.",,45,12,14,1,67,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0275-7540,1029-0370,,CHEM ECOL,Chem.

However, the precise underlying mechanism remains unclear. In particular, not much is known about the expression of ER alpha and ER beta in the stress-sensitive brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala. Using a rodent model of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), we report that two weeks of CUMS in young male mice (10 +/- 2 weeks) induces noteworthy changes in the ratio of ER alpha/ER beta in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. While we observed a significant (P < 0.05) increase in ERa mRNA and protein expression levels, the expression of ER beta in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala was significantly reduced. This increase in ER alpha expression with concomitant decrease in ER beta expression was associated with increased anxiety- and depression-like behaviour as observed in elevated plus maze test, open field test, forced swim test and sucrose preference test. In addition to these behavioural changes, we report the decrease of dendritic complexity with concomitant increase in spine density in the medial prefrontal cortex, dorsohippocampal CA3 region and basolateral complex of amygdala (BLA). Taken together, these results suggest that the CUMS-induced increase in the ratio of ER alpha/ER beta causes dendritic remodeling, which in turn might be responsible for increase in anxiety- and depression-like behaviour in young male mice.

The reduced egg quality results in poor fertilization rate, embryo quality and reproductive outcome. Although postovulatory aging-induced abortive SEA has been reported in several mammalian species, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying this process remains to be elucidated. The postovulatory aging-induced morphological and cellular changes are characterized by partial cortical granules exocytosis, zona pellucida hardening, exit from metaphase-II (M-II) arrest and initiation of extrusion of second polar body in aged eggs. The molecular changes include reduction of adenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) level, increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thereby cytosolic free calcium (Ca2+) level. Increased levels of cAMP and/or ROS trigger accumulation of Thr-14/Tyr-15 phosphorylated cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) on one hand and degradation of cyclin B1 through ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis on the other hand to destabilize maturation promoting factor (MPF). The destabilized MPF triggers postovulatory aging-induced abortive SEA and limits various assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) outcome in several mammalian species. Use of certain drugs that can either increase cAMP or reduce ROS level would prevent postovulatory aging-induced deterioration in egg quality so that more number of good quality eggs can be made available to improve ART outcome in mammals including human.","[Prasad, Shilpa; Tiwari, Meenakshi; Chaube, Shail K.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Cell Physiol Lab, Biochem Unit, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Koch, Biplob] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Genotoxicol & Canc Biol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Chaube, SK (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Cell Physiol Lab, Biochem Unit, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",shailchaubey@gmail.com,"Chaube, Shail/ABC-1337-2020; Chaube, Shail K/O-3558-2019; Koch, Biplob/AAI-4449-2021","PRASAD, SHILPA/0000-0002-9547-1782","Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India","Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India(Department of Biotechnology (DBT) IndiaMinistry of Science and Technology, Government of India)","The part of this study was funded by Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India.",,75,33,33,0,26,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1021-7770,1423-0127,,J BIOMED SCI,J.

Groundwater occurs in fractures in hard rock area. A detailed survey of the area was done using satellite imagery to extract the lineament, and appropriate locations were selected for integrated electrical (resistivity method) and electromagnetic (VLF-EM) geophysical surveys. Very low frequency electromagnetic (VLF-EM) survey was conducted along ten traverse profiles. Qualitative interpretation of VLF-EM was done using Fraser and Karous-Hjelt filtering techniques which generate Fraser-filtered real data curves as well as pseudo-current density cross section along each profile. The interpretation result (anomaly) of VLF-EM may or may not delineate the appropriate fracture zone based on a number of higher values of relative current density which correspond to the subsurface feature. Four gradient profiling (GP) surveys of DC resistivity method were carried out at the position of the VLF-EM anomaly and to correlate the anomaly of gradient profile and VLF-EM anomaly which located the position of vertical electrical sounding (VES) and also the fracture zone. VLF-EM and subsequent resistivity surveys (GP and VES) at suitable locations suggest the existence of a fracture zone in the part of Vindhyan fringe belt of Ahraura region of Mirzapur district for the purpose of groundwater exploration.","[Kumar, Rajan; Yadav, Girija Shankar] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Geophys, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Kumar, R (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Geophys, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",rajan.08.ism@gmail.com,,,,,,,37,3,3,0,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1866-7511,1866-7538,,ARAB J GEOSCI,Arab.

Simultaneously, the worldwide bio-ethanol production is increasing constantly. The maize, sugarcane and sugar beets are major traditional agricultural crops used as bio-ethanol production but these crops are unable to meet the global demand of bio-ethanol production due to their primary value of food and feed. Hence, cellulosic materials such as agro-residues are attractive feedstock for bio-ethanol production. The cellulosic material is the most abundant biomass and agro-residues on the earth. Bio-ethanol from agro-residues could be a promising technology that involves four processes of pre-treatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, fermentation and distillation. These processes have several challenges and limitations such as biomass transport and handling, and efficient pre-treatment process for removing the lignin from the lignocellulosic agro-residues. Proper pre-treatment process may increase the concentrations of fermentable sugars after enzymatic hydrolysis, thereby improving the efficiency of the whole process. Others, efficient microbes and genetically modified microbes may also enhance the enzymatic hydrolysis. Conversion of cellulose to ethanol requires some new pre-treatment, enzymatic and fermentation technologies, to make the whole process cost effective. In this review, we have discussed about current technologies for sustainable bioethanol production from agro-residues. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Iron at lower concentrations (<= 50 mu M) causes increase in chlorophyll a, carotenoid, phycocyanin, carbohydrate, protein, nitrogenase, nitrate reductase and glutamine synthetase activities in wild type as well as in mutant strain (except nitrogenase and nitrate reductase activities), while higher concentrations (>50 mu M) were toxic and cause significant reductions in these physiological attributes. Nitrogenase and nitrate reductase activity were found absent in ntcA mutant. Further, 50 mu M iron concentration also supported the maximum heterocyst frequency with changed heterocyst spacing pattern in wild type, whereas no visible sign of heterocyst development was observed in mutant strain. SDS-PAGE of whole cell protein revealed the occurrence of maximum number of bands at 50 mu M iron concentration in both wild type and mutant strain.

Of the six analysed tissues of sea-nodule-effluent-exposed fish, liver accumulated highest concentration of most of the metals (2.91-287.36 mg kg(-1)) while muscles (2.1-81.14 mg kg(-1)) lowest. While the concentration of Fe was maximum (60.41-218.7 mg kg(-1)) in all the tissue systems (except muscles and liver), Pb was minimum (0.8-2.91 mg kg(-1)). Accumulation of most of the metals in all the tissues was above the safe limits as recommended by Food and Agricultural Organisation that indicate metal's potential hazardous impact on the fish. High bioaccumulation factors for these metals in the different tissues revealed that metals were extensively bio accumulated and bio concentrated. The time-dependent variation in metal pollution index illustrated increase in gross metal load (p < 0.05) in different tissue components with increase in exposure period. In conclusion, the sea nodule effluent was found to cause adverse health impact on the fish which in turn might also affect the human health when consumed.","[Vaseem, H.; Banerjee, T.

The acidic pH followed by alkaline pH in the small intestine might be responsible for expression of certain stress-induced genes, resulting in not only better survival but also induction of multiplication and invasion of the bacterium in the small intestine. Based on this hypothesis, we developed a process wherein we exposed the blood, urine, and stool specimens from 90 acute typhoid fever patients and 36 chronic typhoid carriers to acidic pH to see the effect on isolation rate of S. Typhi. About 5 g of freshly passed unpreserved stool, a centrifuged deposit of 15 ml of urine, and 5 ml of blood clot were subjected to 5 ml of Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (pH 3.5) for 20 min, followed by enrichment in bile broth-selenite F broth. When the combined isolation from all 3 specimens, i.e., blood, urine, and stool, after acid exposure was considered, a total of 77.7% of the acute typhoid patients were observed to be positive for the isolation of the S. Typhi serotype, compared to 8.8% by the conventional method. Similarly, 42% (15/36) of chronic carriers yielded positive for S. Typhi growth after acid exposure, compared to 5.5% (2/36) by the conventional method. It therefore can be concluded that acid shock triggers the multiplication of the bacteria, resulting in better isolation rates from blood clot, stool, and urine specimens.","[Ahirwar, Suneel Kumar; Pratap, Chandra Bhan; Patel, Saurabh Kumar; Nath, Gopal] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Microbiol, Inst Med Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Shukla, Vijay K.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Gen Surg, Inst Med Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Singh, Indarjeet Gambhir; Kumar, Kailash] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Med, Inst Med Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Mishra, Om Prakash] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Pediat, Inst Med Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Singh, Tej Bali] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Community Med, Inst Med Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Nath, G (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Microbiol, Inst Med Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",gopalnath@gmail.com,"NATH, GOPAL/GSN-5212-2022","NATH, GOPAL/0000-0003-2722-1308; Shukla, Vijay/0000-0002-2585-3478","Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), New Delhi, India","Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), New Delhi, India(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India)","We gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), New Delhi, India, in the form of a Junior Research Fellowship awarded to Chandra Bhan Pratap.",,21,4,4,0,9,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",0095-1137,1098-660X,,J CLIN MICROBIOL,J.

We present a series of 24 cases of male ARM managed without ligation of fistula. Material and methods: A prospective study was conducted between July 2010 and June 2012 including male neonates with ARM, where rectobladder neck and rectoprostatic fistula were approached by the abdominal route. The fistulous tract was dissected to the distal-most possible length and was excised flush with the urethra without its ligation. A per-urethral catheter was placed in situ. A record was made of any features of urinary leak and a micturating cystourethrogram was performed at the 1-year of follow-up. Results: Twenty-four cases of ARM, 16 with rectobladder neck fistula and eight cases with rectoprostatic fistula were included. Of these, 12 had single-stage primary abdominoperineal pull-through and 10 were managed by primary posterior sagittal anorectoplasty. Two cases with colostomy during the neonatal period were managed by laparoscopic assisted anorectoplasty at 6 months. None of the cases had a urinary leak during the postoperative period. All had a normal micturating cystourethrogram at 1 year. Conclusions: The approach of dividing fistula without ligation may prevent posterior urethral diverticula, but larger long-term follow-up studies are needed.

These graft copolymers were used to prepare Cu(II) and Ni(II) chelates by reactions with Cu(II) and Ni(II) metal ions respectively. Graft copolymer and metal chelates were characterized by elemental analysis, intrinsic viscosity, FT-IR, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). Elemental analysis, intrinsic viscosity and FT-IR studies revealed the incorporation of metal ions to form metal chelates. SEM studies showed the change in morphology due to metal incorporation. From AFM studies it was observed that there was increase in Root mean square (RMS) roughness values in case of metal complexes. Metal chelates were observed to be thermally more stable than graft copolymer from TGA. UV-vis spectroscopy study revealed increase in absorbance values and cyclic voltammetric (CV) studies showed more than tenfold increase in redox current due to formation of Cu(II) and Ni(II) metal chelates.

Allicin is the most important, pharmaceutically-active metabolite in garlic (Allium sativum L.) and is known for its antibacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-atherosclerotic activities. Duplication of the diploid garlic genome was induced by treating garlic stem discs with 0.5% (w/v) colchicine. The tetraploids possessed thicker and darker-green leaves compared to untreated control plants and also showed pronounced differences in stomatal size. Leaves on the tetraploid clones exhibited smaller length-to-width ratios, but their leaf areas were up to three-times higher than in control diploid plants. These morphological characteristics were used as reliable phenotypic markers to screen for autotetraploid clones from a mixed population of polyploids and control diploid plants. In comparison to control diploid garlic plants, autotetraploid plants exhibited an average 30.7% increase in allicin concentration. The increase was measured indirectly as a significant increase in pyruvate concentration (87.15 +/- 0.86 mu mol g(-1) FW), which is a by-product of allicin biosynthesis. This study demonstrated that autotetraploids of garlic with increased concentrations of secondary metabolites can be generated successfully through in vitro stem-disc culture with 0.5% (w/v) colchicine.","[Dixit, V.; Chaudhary, B.

Disturbances in redox equilibrium of cells result in pro-inflammatory conditions, and these inflammatory conditions can induce carcinogenesis or increase the malignant potential of the tumor. Oxidative stress or tissue damage can trigger toll-like receptor (TLR) family of receptors that are involved in altering the innate immune system. The present study was aimed at evaluating the level of oxidative damage markers in breast diseases by measuring the 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), protein carbonyl (PC), malondialdehyde (MDA), and total antioxidant status (TAS) alterations in relation to expression of TLR-9. A significant increase in the level of oxidative damage markers was observed in breast carcinoma patients in comparison to benign and normal controls, which was accompanied by a significant decrease in TAS and expression of TLR-9 concentrations. 8-OHdG, PC, and MDA were negatively correlated with expression of TLR-9 and TAS levels. Altered levels of biomarkers of oxidative stress and TLR-9 among the malignant, benign, and controls suggest a correlation of oxidative stress and TLR signaling in the progression of disease in breast carcinoma patients. Receiver operating characteristic analysis depicts that expression of TLR-9 is a good indicator for distinguishing cancer patients from benign and normal controls. High accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of oxidative stress markers and expression of TLR-9 can be used as discriminatory marker/s for efficient diagnosis.","[Karki, Kanchan; Pande, Deepti; Negi, Reena; Khanna, Hari D.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Biophys, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Khanna, Seema] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Gen Surg, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Khanna, Ranjana S.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Khanna, HD (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Biophys, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",hdkhanna@yahoo.co.in,,,"Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi (India); University Grants Commission, New Delhi","Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi (India); University Grants Commission, New Delhi(University Grants Commission, India)","This work was supported by Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi (India).

Both endogenous and exogenous melatonin modulates lymphocyte proliferation via its specific membrane receptors, Mel(1a), Mel(1b) and Mel(1c), though the mechanisms behind this process are poorly understood. We investigated the differences in melatonin membrane receptor Mel(1a), Mel(1b) and Mel(1c) expression by western blot and reverse transcription reaction and the in vitro effect of melatonin on the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in splenocytes of the Indian Jungle Bush Quail, Perdicula asiatica. We used a non-selective melatonin receptor antagonist for Mel(1a) and Mel(1b), luzindole, and the selective Mel(1b) blocker, 4P-PDOT to check the specific role of melatonin receptor on ([Ca2+]i). The expression of Mel(1a), Mel(1b) and Mel(1c) receptors mRNA and protein was upregulated by melatonin (10(-7) M) with a significant high rise in ([Ca2+]i), which was differentially blocked by supplementation of antagonist, luzindole (10(-7) M) and 4P-PDOT (10(-7) M). Furthermore, we noted in vitro effect of melatonin and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), a cell-permeable antagonist of inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor to check the rise in ([Ca2+]i) through the IP3 pathway. Significantly low ([Ca2+]i) was noted in melatonin and 2-APB pretreated splenocytes when compared with splenocytes where 2-APB was absent. Thus, our data suggest that melatonin through its membrane receptor induced the elevation of ([Ca2+]i) via IP3-dependent pathway for splenocyte proliferation in P. asiatica.","[Yadav, Sanjeev Kumar; Haldar, Chandana] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Pineal Res Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Singh, Sunil Kumar; Dash, Debabrata] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Biochem, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Haldar, C (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Pineal Res Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",chaldar2001@yahoo.com,"Singh, Sunil/AAM-5173-2021; DASH, DEBABRATA/AAF-1837-2020","Singh, Sunil/0000-0001-6603-6282; ","Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi, India","Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi, India(Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR))","Instrument gift by Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, Bonn, Germany to CH is highly acknowledged.

The isozyme CbE-4 was characterized as typical serine esterase, whereas CbE-1, CbE-2, and CbE-3 were identified as sulphhydryl group-dependent serine esterases. In vitro treatment of skin mucus with the organophosphorus insecticide, Nuvan(A (R)) showed strong inhibition of CbE activity. In vivo exposure of the fish to sublethal test concentrations (5 and 15 mg/l) of the insecticide also revealed significant inhibition of CbE activity in mucus.

This immobilization was found to be a combination of covalent attachment as well as ionic adsorption. Analysis of variance showed that the obtained mathematical model is significant to carry out further studies. The biochemical properties of this bio-conjugate experienced a slight shift from the optimum of its free form equivalent. This change was found favourable with respect to its utilization in industrial sector. Optimal pH and temperature were 6.0 and 70 degrees C, respectively. Though there was not much change in optimum temperature but the immobilized enzyme was functionally active at higher temperatures. Immobilization showed positive effect when thermal inactivation at 67 degrees C resulted in first-order kinetics with t(1/2) 126 min. It retained 77% residual activity after 10 uses and 80% residual activity on 2 months of storage at 4 degrees C. These properties provide impetus for its utility for commercial purpose.

Species varied markedly in the composition and IVI at different sites. The semi-evergreen species, Shorea robusta, was dominant at the wettest site at all the three growth stages; at the driest site, highly deciduous species Lannea coromandelica was the dominant adult species and Nyctanthis arbortristis the dominant sapling and seedling species. Soil moisture content (SMC) altered the distribution of about 8% of the adult species. ANOVA indicated significant site-wise differences in the Shannon-Wiener index, Whittaker's evenness, Margalef's species richness, and beta-diversity for the woody species at all the three stages. The Shannon-Wiener index, Whittaker's evenness, Margalef's species richness, and beta-diversity were greater in seedlings as compared to adult and saplings of tree species.

Aromatic interactions are, themselves, very weak interactions in the range 0-1 kcal mol(-1), but these interactions, along with the other non-covalent interactions, play an important role in determining molecular recognition processes in chemistry and biology. Of course, hydrogen bonding is strong enough to provide a sufficient host and guest interaction, but in the case of aromatic systems or hydrophobic systems in absence of sites for hydrogen bonding, aromatic interactions exhibit an effect of cooperatively coming to closure to the other molecules. These forces may be electrostatic in nature, influenced by the presence of electrostatic functional groups. But, sometimes, dispersion interaction dominates over the electrostatic interaction. Thus, various factors are responsible for the existence of aromatic interactions, which are studied in the present manuscript in detail.","[Tewari, Ashish Kumar; Srivastava, Priyanka; Singh, Ved Prakash; Singh, Praveen; Khanna, Ranjana S.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Tewari, AK (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",tashish2002@yahoo.com,,"Singh, Praveen/0000-0002-4740-3152",,,,,140,15,15,0,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-6168,1568-5675,,RES CHEM INTERMEDIAT,Res.

The versatility of this pathway to influence different aspects of development comes from its multiple levels of regulation. Upon ligand-induced Notch activation, the Notch intracellular domain (Notch-ICD) is released from the membrane and translocates to the nucleus, where it transduces Notch signals by regulating the transcription of downstream target genes. But the exact mechanism of translocation of Notch-ICD into the nucleus is not clear. Here, we implicate Importin-alpha 3 (also known as karyopherin-alpha 3) in the nuclear translocation of Notch-ICD in Drosophila. Our present analyses reveal that Importin-alpha 3 can directly bind to Notch-ICD and loss of Importin-alpha 3 function results in cytoplasmic accumulation of the Notch receptor. Using MARCM (Mosaic Analysis with a Repressible Cell Marker) technique, we demonstrate that Importin-alpha 3 is required for nuclear localization of Notch-ICD. These results reveal that the nuclear transport of Notch-ICD is mediated by the canonical Importin-alpha 3/Importin-beta transport pathway. In addition, co-expression of both Notch-ICD and Importin-alpha 3 displays synergistic effects on cell proliferation. Taken together, our results suggest that Importin-alpha 3 mediated nuclear import of Notch-ICD may play important role in regulation of Notch signaling.","[Sachan, Nalani; Mishra, Abhinava K.; Mutsuddi, Mousumi; Mukherjee, Ashim] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Mukherjee, A (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",amukherjee@bhu.ac.in,"Mishra, Abhinava K./AAO-6303-2020","Mishra, Abhinava K./0000-0003-3733-3928","Indian Council of Medical Research and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India; Department of Science and Technology, India; Department of Biotechnology, India","Indian Council of Medical Research and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India; Department of Science and Technology, India(Department of Science & Technology (India)); Department of Biotechnology, India(Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India)","N.S. and A K.M. were supported by fellowships from Indian Council of Medical Research and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India, respectively.

Identification of potential indigenous rhizobia as competitive inoculants for efficient nodulation and N-2-fixation of soybean was assessed under laboratory and field conditions. Two indigenous bradyrhizobial isolates (MPSR033 and MPSR220) and its derived different antibiotic (streptomycin and gentamicin) and phage (RT5 and RT6)-resistant mutant strains were used for competition study. Nodulation occupancy between parent and mutant strains was compared on soybean cultivar JS335 under exotic condition. Strain MPSR033 Sm-r V-r was found highly competitive for nodule occupancy in all treatment combinations. On the basis of laboratory experiments four indigenous strains (MPSR033, MPSR033 Sm-r, MPSR033 Sm-r V-r, MPSR220) were selected for their symbiotic performance along with two exotic strains (USDA123 and USDA94) on two soybean cultivars under field conditions. A significant symbiotic interaction between Bradyrhizobium strains and soybean cultivar was observed. Strain MPSR033 Sm-r V-r was found superior among the rhizobial treatments in seed yield production with both cultivars. The 16S rRNA region sequence analysis of the indigenous strains showed close relationship with Bradyrhizobium yuanmingense strain. These findings widen out the usefulness of antibiotic-resistance marked phage-resistant bradyrhizobial strains in interactive mode for studying their symbiotic effectiveness with host plant, and open the way to study the mechanism of contact-dependent growth inhibition in rhizobia.","[Anand, Akhil; Jaiswal, Sanjay Kumar; Dhar, Banshi; Vaishampayan, Akhouri] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Agr Sci, Dept Genet & Plant Breeding, Microbiol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Jaiswal, SK (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Agr Sci, Dept Genet & Plant Breeding, Microbiol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",sanjay_siswa@yahoo.com,"JAISWAL, SANJAY/AAI-8262-2021","JAISWAL, SANJAY/0000-0003-2745-9949","Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India, New Delhi, India","Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India, New Delhi, India(Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India)","The work was financially supported by the Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India, New Delhi, India.",,36,7,7,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0343-8651,1432-0991,,CURR MICROBIOL,Curr.

Structural modifications in these materials are usually described with respect to the values of structural units (or average coordination number). In significance to this, the present work demonstrates the chronological development in the field of chalcogenide glasses along with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) morphologies. Optical, electrical and thermal correlative properties of recent developed Se93-xZn2Te5Inx (0 a parts per thousand currency sign x a parts per thousand currency sign 10) metallic multicomponent chalcogenide glasses are discussed. Variation in SEM morphology, refractive index (n), extinction coefficient (K), optical energy band gap (E-g), electrical conductivity (sigma(av)), crystallization activation energy (E-c) and glass forming ability (GFA) with structural units of Se-Zn-Te-In glasses have been demonstrated in this study. Subjected materials thermal, optical and electrical parameters have been achieved higher and lower in a respective manner at the threshold structural unit value aOE (c) r >.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Phys, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Singh, AK (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Phys, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",abhaysngh@rediffmail.com,,,,,,,148,9,9,0,25,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1230-3402,1896-3757,,OPTO-ELECTRON REV,Opto-Electron.

Peak O-3 concentrations have declined in Europe and North America due to reductions in precursors during the last decades, however, emissions of O-3 precursors have increased in Asia. The current critical level of ozone is determined by the threshold for yield loss which is based on the seasonal sum of the external concentration above 40 ppb. In the present article, the impact of tropospheric O-3 on crop photosynthesis, defense mechanism, growth, reproductive processes and yield of crop plants have been documented. O-3 upon its entry into the leaf intercellular spaces rapidly forms reactive oxygen species and reacts with components of the leaf apoplast to initiate a complex set of responses that constitute variable countermeasures by antioxidative enzymes. Ozone affects photosynthetic process by influencing photosynthetic pigments, chlorophyll fluorescence kinetics and electron transport as well as carbon fixation in terms of decreased Rubisco activity and quantity. Translocation and allocation pattern of photosynthate also get influenced under O-3, which affect reproductive processes and yield of crops. Plant species and cultivars exhibit a range of sensitivity to O-3, which is identifiable in terms of biochemical, physiological, molecular and yield responses. Hence, understanding of cultivar sensitivity in context to O-3 would be helpful in development of potential O-3 biomarkers and O-3 tolerant variables.","[Rai, Richa; Agrawal, Madhoolika] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Bot, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Agrawal, M (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Bot, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",madhoo58@yahoo.com,,,"Department of Science and Technology, New Delhi","Department of Science and Technology, New Delhi(Department of Science & Technology (India))","The authors are thankful to the Head, Department of Botany for all the laboratory facilities and to the Department of Science and Technology, New Delhi for providing financial support to the work.

Further, in view of the role of neurohypophysial peptide arginine vasotocin (AVT) in many physiological processes including age/reproduction related oviposition, expression of ir-AVT was also monitored in the ovary of quail. All the parameters associated with histodifferentiation increased rapidly during the developing stages followed by a decrease in old age, which also increased in reproductively quiescent photorefractory birds following estradiol treatment and decreased in reproductively active photosensitive quail following tamoxifen treatment. Using AVT-specific antibody, expression of immunoreactive AVT (ir-AVT) observed in the ovary of photosensitive quail was not detected in the photorefractory quail. However, administration of estrogen in the photorefractory quail stimulated the growth and activity of ovary and shell gland also resulted in the expression of ovarian ir-AVT. On the other hand, tamoxifen eliminated the localization of ir-AVT in the ovary of photosensitive quail in addition to a decrease in the shell gland protein and alkaline phosphatase activity. It is concluded that estrogen not only affects the growth and differentiation of ovary and oviduct including shell gland but also regulates the expression of ovarian AVT. It is also suggested that in addition to reported paracrine effect of AVT in the shell gland of Japanese quail for oviposition, ovarian AVT may also affect ovarian function (ovulation), and in part, this regulation is estrogen dependent.

Self oscillation can be achieved when the gain arising from the four-beam coupling is large enough to overcome the cavity loss. The effects of frequency detuning (i.e., non-degeneracy), dielectric constant and photoconductivity of the photorefractive materials on the performance of the semilinear photorefractive coherent resonator with the reflection grating configuration have also been studied in detail. The phase-conjugate reflectivity of the pumped crystal and oscillation intensity has been calculated for different input pump beam intensity ratio, intensity reflectivity of the conventional mirrors, degenerate energy coupling strength of the interacting beams. It has been found that for the higher value of the photoconductivity sigma(p)(>2.0 pS/cm) of photorefractive crystal, the semilinear resonator can oscillate at almost any frequency detuning (Omega) of the oscillation beam with respect to the fixed frequency of the pump waves whereas for the lower value of photoconductivity sigma(p)(<0.1 pS/cm) oscillation occurs only when the frequency detuning is limited to small region around Omega = 0.

It not only affects human beings but also vegetation and indirectly increases global warming. An estimate has shown that vehicular exhaust contributes about 64% of the CO pollution in developed countries. Due to the exponentially increasing number of automobiles on roads, CO concentrations have reached an alarming level in urban areas and regulatory measures had been adopted to curb the menace of vehicular pollution. To control vehicular exhaust pollution, end-of-pipe-technology using noble metals catalytic converters are recommended. The increasing prices of noble metals with the increasing number of vehicles motivates the investigation of material concepts to reduce the precious metal content in automotive catalysts or to find a substitute for noble metals. Among non-noble metals, copper chromite is found to be most promising and exhibits comparable activity for CO oxidation to that of precious metals. Further, low cost, easy availability and advance synthesis methods with stabilizer, promoter, etc. advocates for the use of copper chromite as an auto exhaust purification catalyst. There is a lot of literature available on copper chromite catalyst for CO oxidation, but still there is a gap in the literature for a review article solely devoted to copper chromite catalyst for CO oxidation. Therefore, in an attempt to fill this gap, the present review updates and evaluates the progress and future scope for copper chromite catalyst for purification of exhaust gases of low sulfur contents. The requirement to develop successful methods to reclaim the components of the spent copper chromite catalyst for its safe disposal is also discussed. The paper is useful for people who want to quickly know the state of art and all the aspects concerning the investigated materials.

Mostly available names/terms are suggested in terms of metamorphic facies/grades. Many times it is difficult to name a MMIR, particularly if one is interested to study MMIR to know their magmatic origin. This problem persists because of the IUGS recommendation that any rock (igneous or metamorphic) must be named or classified on the basis of its mineral composition and not on its chemistry. In many cases, more than one name/term is available to denote a particular type of MMIR, and for a similar mineral assemblage, different names/terms are used by different workers. This creates avoidable confusion. It is more difficult if one is studying a terrain having MMIR of different metamorphic facies. There is a need to evaluate available classifications for the MMIR and have a single classification scheme for MMIR. In this communication an attempt is made to propose a scheme for classifying MMIR. It is believed that this nomenclature/classification scheme would help to avoid some confusion while referring to MMIR.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Geol, Ctr Adv Study, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Srivastava, RK (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Geol, Ctr Adv Study, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",rajeshgeolbhu@yahoo.com,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,5,WADIA INST HIMALAYAN GEOLOGY,DEHRA DUN,"33 GENERAL MAHADEO SINGH RD, DEHRA DUN, 248 001, INDIA",0971-8966,,,HIMAL GEOL,Himal.

This study aimed to find an effective diagnostic modality for the condition. Methods : A total of 100 infertile women were clinically evaluated with haemoglobin estimation, total and differential count, Mantoux test, tubercle bacilli enzymel inked immunosorbent assay (TB ELISA), hysterosalpingography, pelvic ultrasonography, laparohysteroscopy, premenstrual endometria l biopsy for histopathology, culture and tubercle bacilli polymerase chain reaction (TBPCR). The womens' Day 2 hormonal profile (luteinising, follicle-stimulating, prolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormones) and their husbands' semen analysis were also conducted. Results : A total of 58 women had primary infertility and 42 had secondary infertility. Female factor infertility was present in 63 percent of the cases (mostly tubal; 45.97 percent). 26 women tested positive for endometrial TBPCR. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, Mantoux test, TB ELISA and hysterosalpingography were found to have high negative predictive value (greater than 80 percent), while the positive predictive value was 35-45 percent. Laparoscopy findings were suggestive of tuberculosis in 13 percent of the women, out of which 83.3 percent were positive for endometrial TBPCR. Hysteroscopy revealed intrauterine adhesions in 34.8 percent of the women, with 68.8 percent being positive for tubercular bacilli. Conclusion: Our study established that in cases of genital tuberculosis, the use of expensive endometrial TBPCR tests may be avoided with a detailed workup, which would also help in the institution of anti-tubercular treatment in early disease, thus enhancing the chance of pregnancy.","[Khanna, A.; Agrawal, A.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Obstet & Gynaecol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Khanna, A (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Obstet & Gynaecol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",dr_anuradhakhanna@yahoo.co.in,,,,,,,14,17,21,0,5,SINGAPORE MEDICAL ASSOC,SINGAPORE,"2985 JALAN BUKIT MERAH, #02-2C, SMF BUILDING, SINGAPORE, SINGAPORE",0037-5675,,,SINGAP MED J,Singap.

Different techniques used for structural characterization divulge the formation of spherical Ho:Yb:Gd2O3 crystals of diameter similar to 100 nm. Efficient energy transfer from Yb3+ -> Ho3+ ions set spherical nanocrystal to emit in the range of UV-NIR via three NIR photons absorption process. Power dependence and the temporal evolution of upconversion emission intensity suggest the occurrence of a photon avalanche process. The enhancement in emission intensity in nanophosphor sample has been explained and the photophysics involved is correlated with the unique structural properties of the crystallites formed and the time resolved spectroscopy.

The bat treated in vivo with flutamide, an androgen antagonist, showed loss of spermatozoa at the storage site, utero-tubal junction. Immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis revealed the presence of increased expression of Bcl2 in the epithelial cell lining of the utero-tubal junction during the period of sperm-storage. Treatment with testosterone in vitro caused a significant dose-dependent increase in expression of the survival factor Bcl2, whereas treatment with flutamide together with testosterone caused a significant decline in Bcl2 in the utero-tubal junction of S. heathii. Together with the expression of Bcl2, the utero-tubal junction also expresses the death signal, caspase3. Expression of caspase3 decreased during January, but increased in February during the late stage of sperm storage. Androgen stimulated Bcl2 synthesis in the utero-tubal junction via the non-genomic MAP kinase signaling pathway. In conclusion, this study suggests that androgen promotes sperm storage in S. heathii by stimulating the survival factor Bcl2 in the utero-tubal junction. It is further hypothesized that a balance between the survival factor, Bcl2, and the death signal, caspase3, determines the duration of sperm storage in S. heathii. Mol. Reprod.

The present levels of ozone may not induce visible symptoms in most of plants, but can result in substantial losses in reproductive output. This paper considers the impact of ambient O-3 on gas exchange, photosynthetic pigments, chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence and carbohydrate levels in the flag leaf of wheat plants during various stages of reproductive development using open-top chambers. Mean O-3 concentration was 45.7 ppb during wheat growth and 50.2 ppb after flag leaf development. Reproductive stage showed higher exceedence of O-3 above 40 ppb compared to the vegetative stage. Diurnal variations in net photosynthetic rate (P (N)) and stomatal conductance (g (s)), intercellular CO2 concentration (C (i)), Fv/Fm ratio, photosynthetic pigments, soluble sugars, and starch were measured at 10, 30, and 50 days after flag leaf expansion (DAFE). The results showed reductions in P (N), g (s), F-v/F-m ratio, photosynthetic pigments and starch, and increases in C (i), F-0, and soluble sugars in nonfiltered chambers (NFCs) compared to filtered chambers (FCs). Maximum changes in measured parameters were observed at 50 DAFE (i.e. grain filling and setting phase). Diurnal variation in P (N) showed double peaked curve in both FCs and NFCs, but delayed peak and early depression in NFCs. Stomatal conductance was significantly lower in NFCs. The study suggests that higher prevalence of ambient O-3 during reproductive development led to significant alteration in physiological vitality of wheat having potential negative influence on yield.","[Rai, R.; Agrawal, M.; Agrawal, S.

This article examines how the state's practice of recognising 'tribes' legitimises fixed and legible 'locational dialectal identities' among the 'Zo' in India's north-east and successfully transforms them into receivers of the state's largesse. At the same time, these practices also reveal the unsettled nature and fuzziness of 'tribe' identities as clans, dialects, and languages overlap and cross-cut each other. Although enlisting tribes among the Zo fits the state's 'classificatory' and 'serial-isation' grid, it also highlights the 'narcissism of minor differences' among them. While such enlisting helps expedite the integration of 'tribes' into the Indian state-nation building projects, it also unleashes contentious politics that prevent the emergence of larger frameworks of unity and solidarity across 'tribes'. Against this backdrop, the article ex-amines ongoing attempts among the Zo to redefine and rethink 'tribe' identities to tran-scend their 'locational dialectal identities'.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Suan, HKK (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",kksuanh@gmail.com,"Hausing, Kham Khan Suan/AAY-9747-2020; Hausing, Kham Khan Suan/AAM-6979-2021","Hausing, Kham Khan Suan/0000-0003-3673-6995; ",,,,,82,10,10,0,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INDIA  PVT LTD,NEW DELHI,"B-1-I-1 MOHAN CO-OPERATIVE INDUSTRIAL AREA, MATHURA RD, POST BAG NO 7, NEW DELHI 110 044, INDIA",0069-9667,,,CONTRIB INDIAN SOC,Contrib.

The asymmetric unit consists of a square planar Cu(II) center, with two ligand N atoms and two anionic Ns forming the square plane. In the unit cell, the monomeric complex assembles into 2-D layers through very weak non-bonded interactions between anionic S and Cu2+. Further, the structure was satisfactorily modeled by calculations based on Density Functional Theory (DFT), and the UV-Vis and IR spectra are analyzed in depth with the help of Time Dependent DFT (TDDFT). The results indicate that the absorption maxima are at relatively high energy and are mainly assigned to pi -> pi* transitions (in pyridine), with a fair contribution of metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) and ligand to ligand charge transfer (LLCT) transitions. All the low lying transitions are categorized as mixed MLCT/LLCT. A very weak but broad band in the higher wavelength region has been detected and identified as a d-d transition band. Also, it has been found that when the ligand ratio is modified, the formation of Cu(2-amp)(2)(SCN)(2) takes place under the same self-assembly conditions, whose structure only has been recently reported. Structural, spectral and theoretical comparisons are presented for both complexes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Shukla, Madhulata; Srivastava, Nitin; Saha, Satyen; Rao, T.

For the purpose of study based on eight representative thin sections of Chandarpur and Khairagarh sandstones, measurements of grain size distribution, types of grain contacts, packing density (Pd), packing proximity (Pp) and linear regression analysis has been carried out. The relation of packing density with packing proximity of Khairagarh sandstone shows positive correlation coefficient (r) with linear regression equation (y) and no clear trend in packing proximity (Pp) vs grain size (Is) is observed whereas Chandarpur sandstone shows packing density increases and packing proximity decreases with linear regression equation (y) and correlation coefficient (r). Chandarpur grain size tends to increase with packing density (Pd) whereas packing proximity (Pp) increases but Khairagarh sandstone packing density (Pd) decrease with increase of grain size (Is) and packing proximity (Pp) tends to increase with decrease in grain size.

Ambient O-3 concentrations ranged from 27.7 to 59.04 ppb. Lipid peroxidation, antioxidative enzymes, and metabolites were higher, whereas photosynthetic pigments and protein were lower in all the varieties of mustard grown in non-filtered chambers than in filtered chambers. The magnitude of response varied with varieties, NPK levels and ages. Vardan showed a maximum stimulation in the antioxidative defense system, thus efficient scavenging of ROS produced by O-3 and consequently conferred greater tolerance in terms of least reductions in pigments and protein as compared to Kranti and Aashirwad.

Cisplatin involves enhanced oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and death of tubular cells. Nephroprotective role of PTY, prepared from methanolic extract of tubers of Pueraria tuberosa D.C., has been studied. PTY was orally given to rats in different doses for seven consecutive days, along with cisplatin (8 mg/kg B.W., i.p.) on 4th day. PTY significantly prevented the rise in serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen. It prevented the decline in glutathione content, activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase and also prevented DNA damage, tubular swelling, cellular necrosis and protein cast deposition as compared to experimental control group in kidney. These changes were restored to near normal levels by PTY in dose of 40 mg/100 g B.W. Thus, it is proposed that the PTY possesses dose-dependent protective effect against cisplatin induced kidney damages, primarily through its free radical scavenging property. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Tyrosine. L-DOPA, dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine showed significant seasonal and diurnal changes during the reproductive cycle. A high concentration of tyrosine was detected, the values increased in day and decreased in night during recrudescence from preparatory to spawning phases. Similarly, L-DOPA increased during the breeding phase giving the day value concentration peak in the spawning phase and the night value peak in the postspawning phase. DA activity or turnover index (calculated as a ratio of DA to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, DOPAC) showed a bimodal pattern with the major activity peak in the postspawning phase and the minor one in the prespawning phase, the spawning phase registered the lowest activity. NE activity or turnover index (ratio of NE to normetanephrine, NME) increased during the recrudescent phase to give the peak in the spawning phase and decreased in the quiescent phase. Epinephrine elicited an inverse relationship in the day-night pattern, the day values increased to the peak in the spawning phase. All the study correlates showed significant periovulatory changes after hCG treatment. DA activity dropped to the nadir at 8 h but recovered at 16 and 24 h. NE activity showed only a marginal decrease up to 16 h but decreased drastically at 24 h. Epinephrine levels remained unchanged but only to increase at 24 h. The seasonal patterns and periovulatory changes strongly point to important functions for catecholamines in the ovary. The occurrence of tyramine (an invertebrate neurotransmitter) suggests the presence of alternate catecholamine pathway in fish ovary. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The 976 nm excitation results a cooperative upconversion emission at 486 nm due to the Yb3+ state and a broad band in the blue region and has been assigned to arise from the defect centers. The 266 nm excitation on the other hand results a broad emission band even from as-synthesized phosphor without doping of Yb, the width of which increases in presence of Yb due to the emission from Yb2+ ions formed in heated samples. The white emission covers almost whole visible region with bandwidth 190 nm. The ions in Yb2+ state has been found to increase with the increase in heating temperature up to 1,273 K.

There is a vertical axial variation of temperature in the upward direction along the walls. The Brinkman extended Darcy model is applied to describe the momentum transfer in the porous region. The viscosity of the fluid layer and the effective viscosity of the porous layer are assumed to be different. Also the thermal conductivities of both fluid and porous layers are assumed to be different. The graphs and tables have been used to distinguish the influence of distinct parameters on the velocity and skin-friction. It is determined that the velocity is intensified on making greater the temperature difference between the walls while increment in the viscosity ratio (porous/fluid) parameter diminishes the velocity of the fluid. It has been observed that the numerical values of the skin-frictions have an increasing tendency with the increment in the values of temperature difference between the walls while decreasing tendency with the increment in the viscosity ratio parameter (porous/fluid).","[Srivastava, N.; Singh, A.

The clinical course consisted of respiratory distress since birth with probability of transient tachypnea of newborn, but routine investigation revealed total leukocyte count of 56000/mu L with 91% blasts, which returned to normal spontaneously during the subsequent 3 weeks. GTG-banded karyotype from peripheral blood was done to detect any mutation, specifically trisomy 21, but the proband revealed trisomy 12 and denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) detected mutation in exon 2 of GATA1. The condition has been described in association with Down syndrome (trisomy 21) but never with trisomy 12. This case demonstrates the importance of knowing this entity so that it is not erroneously diagnosed as a leukemic process. This is extremely important because most cases of TMD resolve spontaneously within a few weeks to months and do not require treatment other than supportive measures.

Various substances are being used to heal these wounds. We sought to observe the effects of autologous epidermal cell suspension dressings on chronic nonhealing ulcers. Methods: We enrolled patients of the wound clinic at University Hospital, Varanasi, India, with nonhealing wounds of more than 6 weeks' duration. We treated the wound beds with sterile dressings and antibiotics until the swab cultures became sterile. We prepared autologous epidermal cell suspensions from skin grafts and used them on the ulcer beds along with Vaseline gauze dressings. Follow-up visits with patients occurred weekly for assessment of wound healing and other changes. Results: Fifteen patients enrolled in our study. Of these, 6 patients had completely healed at 12 weeks, 1 patient at 16 weeks and 2 patients at 20 weeks after treatment. We observed a slow healing response in 6 patients, of whom 1 patient had healed completely at 32 weeks and another at 48 weeks. One patient needed skin grafting, and 3 patients were lost to follow-up.

Data were gathered through a survey of 281 faculty members of Banaras Hindu University, India. Results indicate that in the Indian context, teachers' actual and desired participation was highest in institutional decisions and lowest in technical decisions. Among the personal variables, age, designation, teaching experience and span of service in present institution were found to be significantly related with decisional participation of university teachers.

The surface appeared smooth on the OE and wavy on the EISO. A wavy epithelium is considered to facilitate an increase in its stretchability, during the expansion of the branchial chamber. The OE and the EISO were covered by a mosaic pavement of epithelial cells with characteristic patterns of microridges and microbridges. Interspersed between the epithelial cells were mucous goblet cell pores, which were not significantly different in number in the OE and the EISO. Nevertheless, their surface area in the EISO was significantly higher than in the OE. This could be an adaptation to secrete higher amounts of mucus on the EISO for keeping the branchial chamber lining clean, avoiding clogging, the increased slipperiness reducing friction from water flow and increased efficiency in protecting against microbial attachments.

The absence of the taste buds in the EISO, in contrast to the OE, suggests that their function in the branchial chamber may not be of much significance in this fish.

The present article describes modulation of M4-LDH by this compound in a T-cell lymphoma (Dalton's Lymphoma: DL) vis a vis regression of the tumor in vivo. The compound showed a dose dependent cytotoxicity to DL cells in vitro. When a non toxic dose (10 mg/kg bw i.p.) of Ru(II)-CNEB was administered to DL bearing mice, it also produced a significant decline in DL cell viability in vivo. The DL cells from Ru(II)-CNEB treated DL mice showed a significant decline in the level of M4-LDH with a concomitant release of this protein in the cell free ascitic fluid. A significant increase of nuclear DNA fragmentation in DL cells from Ru(II)-CNEB treated DL mice also coincided with the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c in those DL cells. Importantly, neither blood based biochemical markers of liver damage nor the normal patterns of LDH isozymes in other tissues were affected due to the treatment of DL mice with the compound. These results were also comparable with the effects of cisplatin (an anticancer drug) observed simultaneously on DL mice. The findings suggest that Ru(II)-CNEB is able to regress Dalton's lymphoma in vivo via declining M4-LDH and inducing mitochondrial dysfunction-apoptosis pathway without producing any toxicity to the normal tissues.","[Koiri, Raj K.; Trigun, Surendra K.; Pandey, Kiran; Dixit, Deobrat] Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Adv Studies Zool, Biochem & Mol Biol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Mishra, Lallan; Dubey, Santosh K.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Chem, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Trigun, SK (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Adv Studies Zool, Biochem & Mol Biol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",sktrigun@sify.com,"Pandey, Kiran/AAQ-1546-2020; Koiri, Raj Kumar/L-6485-2016","Pandey, Kiran/0000-0001-8658-2942; Koiri, Raj Kumar/0000-0002-1258-5160; Dixit, Deobrat/0000-0003-4459-3904","Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Govt. of India [BT/PR5910/BRB/10/406/2005]","Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Govt. of India(Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India)","This work was financially supported by a project from Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Govt. of India, (BT/PR5910/BRB/10/406/2005) sanctioned jointly to LM and SKT.

Surgery is the only potentially curative modality of treatment for this disease. Radical cholecystectomy is the optimal surgical standard for resectable gallbladder cancer. This includes cholecystectomy, liver resection (wedge, segments 4b and 5, or extended right hepatectomy), and regional lymphadenectomy along the hepatoduodenal ligament, behind the duodenum and pancreatic head, common hepatic artery and celiac axis. Controversies regarding extent of liver resection, lymphadenectomy and role of multiorgan resection have been discussed. Incidental gallbladder cancer is often detected on histopathologic examination of the simple cholecystectomy specimen removed for a presumed gallstone disease. Revision surgery should be performed for incidental cancers that invade muscularis propria or beyond (T1b or more). Advanced gallbladder cancer should be treated non-operatively with a palliative intent. Obstructive jaundice in the setting of an advanced gallbladder cancer can be palliated with biliary stenting by endoscopic or transhepatic means. Occasionally, a surgical biliary bypass may be indicated to relieve intractable pruritus in a jaundiced patient with gallbladder cancer. There is no role of a planned R2 resection of advanced gallbladder cancer for the purpose of cytoreduction. Further improvement in the management of gallbladder cancer will need integration of systemic chemotherapy with radical surgery.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Surg Oncol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Pandey, D (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Surg Oncol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",durgatosh@gmail.com,,,,,,,20,4,5,0,8,SPRINGER INDIA,NEW DELHI,"7TH FLOOR, VIJAYA BUILDING, 17, BARAKHAMBA ROAD, NEW DELHI, 110 001, INDIA",0972-2068,0973-9793,,INDIAN J SURG,Indian J.

The UC studies have been carried out using 532 nm excitation, and the samples show intense emission bands in ultraviolet (340 and 383 nm), blue (411, 458, 472. and 491 nm), and green (523 nm) regions of spectrum. Downconversion emission bands are also observed in green (550 nm) and red (672 nm) regions. The pump power dependence of the emission intensity shows that two photons are involved in creating one upconverted photon and that excited state absorption is the excitation mechanism. The excitation intensity stimulated switchinglike behavior has been observed in the intensities of some emission bands. Phonon assisted energy migration from the H-2(11/2) (S-4(3/2)) level to the upper F-4(5/2) and (4) F-7/2 levels, opening up a new channel for emission at a certain level of input power, is thought to be the probable cause of a switchinglike mechanism.

The dielectric constant and dielectric loss have been studied in the frequency range of 10 kHz-1 MHz and in the temperature domain of 303-383 K. The a. c. conductivity is found to obey the Universal power law. The variation of frequency exponent with temperature obtained from experimental results has been used to explain the mechanism of ion transport. It has been shown that correlated barrier hopping is the suitable model to study the electrical conduction mechanism of the complexed system. According to this model the maximum barrier height was calculated to be 0.31 eV for un-irradiated sample while for gamma-irradiated, it was 0.28 eV. Moreover, the frequency exponent, which is a function of temperature, decreases slowly in the lower temperature range and at a faster rate in higher temperature range. The electrical activation energy at various frequencies was estimated in the range of 0.44-0.80 eV in two distinct temperature ranges. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Prajapati, G.

Mature somatic embryos developed on MS medium containing high concentration of sucrose (10%) or ABA (1.0 mg l(-1)) showed inhibition in germination if they continued to be in same medium for 4 weeks. With increasing concentrations of sucrose (3-9%) or ABA (0.01-1.0 mg l(-1)) in medium, percent germination of encapsulated somatic embryos decreased significantly. Encapsulated somatic embryos after storage on MS medium supplemented with 9% sucrose or 1 mg l(-1) ABA for different duration (0-60 days) germinated when they were transferred to medium containing 3% sucrose. About 20.8% and 37.5% encapsulated somatic embryos germinated after storage on ABA (1 mg l(-1)) or sucrose (9%) for 60 days, respectively.

Methods Twenty-eight patients who underwent lingual mucosal graft urethroplasty between May 2006 and March 2007 were included in this study. Technique The site of the graft harvest is the lateral mucosal lining of the tongue. Graft harvesting is started from the posterior landmark of the graft on the left side of the tongue. It is continued across the tip of the tongue to the other side if lengthier graft is required. The graft harvesting site is simultaneously closed with continuous running suture using 4-0 polyglactin suture to achieve immediate and good homeostasis. Results Mean duration of follow up was 4.2 months. Average length of harvested graft was 6.5 cm. Mean harvesting time was 18 min. At the first postoperative day, 92% patients experienced pain at donor site and 24% had slurring of speech. By third postoperative day, > 70% were free of pain and four had slurring of speech. By sixth postoperative day, none of the patient suffered pain. All the patients were able to resume oral fluid within 24 h, eat soft solid diet in 48-72 h and return to normal diet after 4-5 days of surgery. No patient suffered from difficulty in opening the mouth, salivation disturbances, peri-oral numbness or difficulty in protrusion of tongue. Conclusion Lingual mucosal graft harvesting is a simple procedure, provides lengthy graft and is associated with minimal donor site complications.","[Kumar, Abhay; Das, Suren K.; Sharma, Girish K.; Pandey, Ashwani K.; Trivedi, Sameer; Dwivedi, Udai S.; Singh, Pratap B.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Urol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Singh, PB (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Urol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",gk_abhay@yahoo.co.in,"trivedi, sameer/AAN-3656-2020","trivedi, sameer/0000-0001-8308-9220",,,,,15,13,15,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0724-4983,,,WORLD J UROL,World J.

An integrated approach was adopted by using vermicompost and an antagonistic strain of Pseudomonas syringae (PUR46) possessing plant growth-promoting characteristics. Treatments with vermicompost (10%, 25%, and 50% v/v) and PUR46 alone and in combination reduced seedling mortality in chickpea under glasshouse conditions. The combined effect of 25% vermicompost substitution along with seed bacterization with PUR46 was the most effective treatment, which not only increased the availability and uptake of minerals like P, Mn, and Fe in chickpea seedlings, resulting in an increase in plant growth, but also reduced plant mortality. These effects are correlated with improvement in soil physical conditions and enhanced nutritional factors due to vermicompost substitution as well as plant growth promotion and the antagonistic activity of PUR46 against the pathogen. Dual cultures of PUR46 with the S. rolfsii isolate revealed a high degree of antagonism by PUR46 against the pathogen. Performance of PUR46 was enhanced in the presence of 25% vermicompost compared with its application alone and therefore this combination may be a useful tool to manage S. rolfsii under field conditions.

Glutathione(GSH) level in both the varieties on control sites increased from basal level to 155.15 nmol g(-1) dry weight (d.wt.),almost 1.5 fold on 30 day and attained a plateau within 60 day. Mine spoil exposure of both the varieties decreased glutathione 1.13 fold (89.2 nmol g(-1) dry weight) during 60 day from its basal level. GSH concentration in shoots of these varieties increased accompanying growth contrary to roots where it finally declined 2 fold. Cysteine content in control plants increased 2 fold (31.6 nmol g-1 dry weight) on 30 day and finally declined 1.38 fold (22,35 nmol g(-1) dry weight, at 60 day). Both the varieties, when exposed to mine spoil, showed enhanced cysteine content almost 2 fold during 30 day (50,95 nmol g(-1) dry weight) but failed to increase further. For shoots in both the varieties challenged with mine spoil, cysteine maxima reached late (15.2 nmol g(-1) dry weight, at 40 day) relative to control but the levels declined subsequently (11.85 nmol g(-1) dry weight). Contrary to GSH, cysteine content in roots of both the varieties responded positively to mine spoil as apparent from the 2.23 fold increase during 30 d than basal level although it lowered to a level of 12.85 nmol g(-1) dry weight finally at 60 day. Both the varieties accumulated almost maximum level of selected cations (Fe > Mn > Zn > Cu > Ni) during 30 day, but BO2 variety was significantly superior in this regard. Invariably high accumulation of such cations in roots over shoots indicated accumulation, retention or restricted translocation from root to shoot.

Thus, present work reflects a genotypic differences in metal accumulation and that affected the major non-enzymatic traits or synthesis of sulfhydryl compounds as well, The present results also indicate that metal tolerance is in part associated with anti-oxidant system activity.","[Arya, Shashi K.; Khalique, Shaista; Kumar, Sanjay; Roy, B.

To study the usefulness of sewage sludge amendment for palak (Beta vulgaris var. Allgreen H-1), a leafy vegetable and consequent heavy metal contamination, a pot experiment was conducted by mixing sewage sludge at 20% and 40% (w/w) amendment ratios to the agricultural soil. Soil pH decreased whereas electrical conductance, organic carbon, total N, available P and exchangeable Na, K and Ca increased in soil amended with sewage sludge in comparison to unamended soil. Sewage sludge amendment led to significant increase in Ph, Cr, Cd, Cu, Zn and Ni concentrations of soil. Cd concentration in soil was found above the Indian permissible limit in soil at both the amendment ratios. The increased concentration of heavy metals in soil due to sewage sludge amendment led to increases in heavy metal uptake and shoot and root concentrations of Ni, Cd, Cu, Cr, Pb and Zn in plants as compared to those grown on unamended soil. Accumulation was more in roots than shoots for most of the heavy metals. Concentrations of Cd, Ni and Zn were more than the permissible limits of Indian standard in the edible portion of palak grown on different sewage sludge amendments ratios. Sewage sludge amendment in soil decreased root length, leaf area and root biomass of palak at both the amendment ratios, whereas shoot biomass and yield decreased significantly at 40% sludge amendment. Rate of photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and chlorophyll content decreased whereas lipid peroxidation, peroxidase activity and protein and proline contents, increased in plants grown in sewage sludge-amended soil as compared to those grown in unamended soil. The study clearly shows that increase in heavy metal concentration in foliage of plants grown in sewage sludge-amended soil caused unfavorable changes in physiological and biochemical characteristics of plants leading to reductions in morphological characteristics, biomass accumulation and yield. The study concludes that sewage sludge amendment in soil for growing palak may not be a good option due to risk of contamination of Cd, Ni and Zn and also due to lowering of yield at higher mixing ratio.

Cervical epidural anesthesia (CEA) is practiced less often because of its reported complications. This prospective study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CEA as an anesthetic technique for MRM. Patients and Methods: Fifty breast cancer patients with ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) grade I or II underwent MRM under CEA from September 2004 to January 2006. Anesthesia was induced with 10 ml of 1% lignocaine; adrenaline was administered through an 18-gauge catheter in C-6-C-7 or C-7-T-1 epidural space. Postoperative analgesia was maintained with 0.125% bupivacaine through the epidural catheter. Results: In 49 (98%) patients surgery was conducted smoothly under CEA with good analgesia. 44 patients were awake during surgery. Five patients had to be given intravenous sedation with midazolam, and in one case the procedure was terminated after accidental dura puncture. There were no clinically significant variations in perioperative pulse and respiratory rate, and there was no fall in mean arterial blood pressure during the procedure. The mean preoperative anesthesia time and total cost of the procedure was 20.36 + 2.75 minutes and 12.19 + 2.2 pound, respectively. All patients were started on a liquid diet and mobilized 4 hours after surgery. Conclusions: Cervical epidural anesthesia is a safe alternative to GA and was preferred by our patients because of its lower cost and reduced perioperative morbidity.","BHU, IMS, Dept Anaesthesiol, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India; BHU, IMS, Dept Surg Oncol, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Shukla, HS (corresponding author), 7 SKG Colony, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India.",harishukla@usa.net,,,,,,,20,16,16,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0364-2313,1432-2323,,WORLD J SURG,World J.Surg.,NOV,2006,30,11,,,,,2043,2049,,10.1007/s00268-006-0117-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00268-006-0117-2,,,7,Surgery,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Surgery,099GN,16927058,,,,2022-12-21,WOS:000241581400013,View Full Record in Web of Science

We emphasize the importance of preservation of a cicatrized stomach and describe its augmentation using a segment of transverse colon. Case report and procedure: A young female with a history of corrosive acid ingestion presented to our surgical unit with nonbilious vomiting following meals, consistent weight loss and features of gastric outlet obstruction. A barium study revealed a small-capacity stomach with pyloric stricture. We planned to augment the stomach capacity by using a segment of transverse colon. After documentation of a normal colon by barium examination, a 15-cm segment of transverse colon was harvested based on middle colic artery. This vascularized patch of bowel was united with the stomach that was opened up by a longitudinal incision made along the body. Result and finding: A barium study on the tenth postoperative day revealed a good capacity and contour of the stomach and free entry of Barium into the small intestine. The patient is tolerating a normal meal and has no vomiting. At 3 months follow-up, the patient had a normal stomach radiologically and endoscopically, with a weight gain of 7 kg. Conclusions: Augmentation of corrosive gastric stricture by a segment of transverse colon is an innovative, practical, and useful procedure, although long-term results are awaited.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Gen Surg, Inst Med Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Kumar, A (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Gen Surg, Inst Med Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",anand_bhu@satyam.net.in,,,,,,,6,4,4,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0179-1958,1432-1262,,INT J COLORECTAL DIS,Int.

The molecular mass (SDS-PAGE), optimum pH and temperature of the enzyme were 51 kDa, pH 8.0 and 60 degrees C, respectively. Milin retains full proteolytic activity over a wide range of pH (5.5-12) and temperature (up to 65 degrees C) with casein and azoalbumin as substrates. The activity of milin is inhibited by serine proteases inhibitors like PMSF, APMSF and DFP, but not by any other protease inhibitors such as E-64 and PCMB. Like the other serine proteases from the genus Euphorbia, the activity of milin was not inhibited by the proteinaceous inhibitor soyabean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI) even at very high concentrations that is naturally present in plants. The specific extinction coefficient (epsilon(1%)(280nm)), molar extinction coefficient (a(m)) and isoelectric point of the enzyme were found to be 29, 152,500 M-1 cm(-1) and pH 7.2, respectively. The enzyme is a glycoprotein with detectable carbohydrate moiety (7-8%) in its constitution, which is essential for the activity. The numbers of tryptophan, tyrosine and cysteine residues in the sequence of milin were estimated chemically and are 23, 14 and 14, respectively. Of the 14-cysteine residues, 12 constituted 6-disulfide linkages while two are free cysteines. The N-terminal sequence (first 12 amino acid residues) was determined and does not match with any sequence of known plant serine proteases. Perturbation studies by temperature, pH and chaotropes of the enzyme also reveal its high stability as seen by CD, fluorescence and proteolytic activity. Thus, this serine protease may have potential applications in food industry. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

A single i.p. injection of human chorionic gonadotrophin (100 IU/fish, sampled at 0, 8 and 16 h) induced oocyte maturation and ovulation, which coincided with significant and progressive increases in 17,20 beta-P, and P-4 and 17-P-4, the precursors of the former. Both cortisol and corticosterone also increased significantly. Conversely, testosterone decreased significantly and progressively over time. Under in vitro conditions, incubation of post-vitellogenic (intact) follicles or follicular envelope (layer) with 2-hydroxyoestradiol (2-OHE2, 5 mu M for 0, 6 and 24 h) elicited a sharp significant increase in 17,20 beta-P, the increase being higher in the follicular envelope incubate. P-4 and 17-P-4 also registered significant increases over the time with the peak values at 24 h. Cortisol and corticosterone increased significantly in the intact follicle, but not in the follicular envelope incubate. Testosterone decreased significantly in the intact follicle, but increased significantly (24 h) in the follicular envelope incubate. Coincident with these changes, the percentage of germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) increased over the time in the intact follicle incubate (48.9% at 6 h and 79.8% at 24 h). Denuded oocytes on incubation with 2-OHE2 (5 mu M) did not produce any significant change in the percentage of GVBD or in the steroid profile. While corticosterone and 17,20 beta-P were undetected, P-4, 17-P-4, cortisol and testosterone were detected in low amounts. The results show that the 2-OHE2-induced GVBD response seems to be mediated through the production of 17,20 beta-P and corticosteroids. It is suggested that hydroxyoestrogens seem to be a component in the gonadotrophin cascade of regulation of oocyte maturation/ovulation in the catfish.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Joy, KP (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",kpjoy@bhu.ac.in,"Joy, Keerikkattil/B-2905-2009",,,,,,47,46,50,0,3,BIOSCIENTIFICA LTD,BRISTOL,"STARLING HOUSE, 1600 BRISTOL PARKWAY N, BRISTOL, ENGLAND",0022-0795,1479-6805,,J ENDOCRINOL,J.

Methods: A retrospective study from the urosurgical unit of a tertiary care referral hospital was carried out. In a retrospective analysis of urogenital fistulae over 10 years, we identified 14 patients with uterovesical fistulae, resulting from caesarean section. All the patients were evaluated by history, physical examination, radiological tests and cystoscopy. All patients underwent transperitoneal repair of these fistulae with omental interposition. Results of surgery were evaluated by absence of cyclic haematuria, stoppage of urinary incontinence, and achievement of fertility. Results: A total of 12 patients who had minimum follow up was included in the present study. The results showed that 50% of the fistulae resulted from emergency caesarean operation with 58% of patients presenting after their second caesarean section. The mean age of the patients was 19 years (range 15-29) and mean duration of symptoms was 7 months (range 3-16). Menouria and amenorrhoea were predominant presenting symptoms. The results of surgical treatment were excellent with good continence and resolution of the cyclic haematuria. Three pregnancies (37.5%) which resulted in elective caesarean section were recorded. Conclusion: Vesicouterine fistulae, despite being infrequent, are no longer a rare diagnosis and are most commonly secondary to lower segment caesarean section. With patient history and selected investigations diagnosis is relatively easy. The surgical repair of these fistulae is standard treatment, especially with delayed fistulae with achievement of total continence, and complete resolution of cyclic haematuria. Meticulous practice of obstetric and surgical principles during caesarean section can prevent the formation of these fistulae.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Urol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Rao, MP (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Urol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",mojjadaprasad@rediffmail.com,"trivedi, sameer/AAN-3656-2020","trivedi, sameer/0000-0001-8308-9220",,,,,22,22,23,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1445-1433,1445-2197,,ANZ J SURG,ANZ J.

Urinary tract infection (55.5%), hypovolemia (22.2%), accelerated hypertension (11.1%) and sepsis (11.1%) were responsible for acute exacerbation of renal failure in 36 (18%) patients. Associated co-morbid conditions were noted in 93 (46.5%) patients. They included; coronary artery disease 46 (49.46%), cerebrovascular disease 20 (21.50%), osteoarthritis 13 (13.97%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 6 (6.45%), dilated cardiomyopathy 5 (5.37%), and malignancy in 3 (3.22%) patients. Acute dialytic support was required in 164 (82%) cases and remaining 36 (18%) patients received conservative management. Mortality was noted in 25 (12.5%) cases. The coronary artery disease (48%), acute pulmonary edema (20%) and hyperkalemia (12%) were the main causes of death. Subsequent evaluation revealed that 102 (51%) patients had ESRD of which only 3 (2.94%) patients could afford CAPD. A total of 11 (10.7%) patients underwent chronic maintenance hemodialysis for 3-4 months and then discontinue dialysis mainly because of financial constraints. Remaining 88 (86.27%) patients with ESRD were discharged from hospital after symptomatic improvement with acute dialysis. Thus, diabetic nephropathy related to type-2 diabetes was the commonest cause of CRF in our elderly patients. Chronic renal failure in elderly was associated with a number of co-morbid conditions, which contributed significantly to morbidity and mortality. Acute on chronic renal failure with severe uremic complications were an important cause of hospitalization. The financial constraint was the major limiting factor for the management of elderly ESRD patients.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Nephrol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Prakash, J (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Nephrol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",jaiprakashbhu@hotmail.com,,,,,,,29,10,10,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0301-1623,,,INT UROL NEPHROL,Int.

The Al50Cu28Fe22,, alloy, synthesized through slow cooling of the molten alloy, was subjected to milling in an attritor mill at 400 rpm for 5 h, 10 It, 20 h, 40 h and 80 h with a ball to powder ratio of 40:1 in hexane medium. The X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy observation of milled samples revealed that the milling duration of 5-40 h has led to the formation of nano-phase. The average crystallite size has been found to be of similar to17 nm. When the nano-crystalline alloy was vacuum annealed at a temperature of similar to500 degreesC for 5-20 h, new structural phases corresponding to the superstructures of crystallite size around 100-200 nm of the parent nano-crystalline phase were identified. The superstructures have been found to correspond to the simple cubic structure with a(sc) = root12ap and the face centred cubic structure with a(fcc) = 2a(p) (a(p): lattice parameter of parent nano-crystalline alloy). It has been proposed that the formation of two different types of superstructures resulting from ball milling followed by annealing is possibly governed by the minimization of free energy of phase constituents.

The pH optima studies of the somatic extract of adult females showed two peaks at 7.0 and 5.0 for collagenase activity. Both forms were purified using sequential DEAE-sepharose and Sephadex G-100 column chromatography. The purified enzymes had the molecular masses of 175 and 20 kDa and pH optima at 7.0 and 5.0, respectively. The 115 kDa collagenase was more sensitive to metal chelators and serine protease inhibitors. However, 20 kDa collagenase was sensitive to cysteine protease inhibitors. The IgG antibodies from W. bancrofti infected human sera inhibited both enzymes. Further the purified collagenases were used to digest total human IgG at their respective pH and for different lengths of time. The 175 kDa protein was capable of cleaving human IgG. The digestion appeared to be restricted to a single cleavage point of H-chain within the hinge region of IgG molecule and produced fragments of similar molecular mass (27 kDa) indicating cleavage to Fab and Fc fragments. The degree of digestion was found to be proportional to the incubation time at 37degreesC. No further digestion of either fragments were observed. The L-chains were apparently resistant to collagenase digestion in all cases. Thus, the results Suggest that S. cervi collagenase might be involved in the defense mechanisms of the parasite against the immune response of the host.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biochem, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Rathaur, S (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biochem, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",sushma@banaras.ernet.in,,,,,,,30,3,3,0,3,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1230-2821,1896-1851,,ACTA PARASITOL,Acta Parasitolog.,SEP,2004,49,3,,,,,253,259,,,,,,7,Parasitology; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Parasitology; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,857SM,,,,,2022-12-21,WOS:000224138600010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Exposure of genomic DNA (in vitro) to UV-B radiation for 1 h did not cause any shift in the absorption peak (lambda(max)) but more than 30% increase in absorbance was noticed in comparison to untreated control DNA (no exposure to UV-B). This increase in absorbance in a way may be comparable to typical hypochromic effect but there was no decrease in absorbance following transfer of UV-B-treated DNA to fluorescent light or in the dark. That the damaging effect of UV-B radiation on native structure of DNA is indeed real was also evident from the PCR-based assay such as RAPD, rDNA amplification, and ARDRA. Template activity of UV-B-treated genomic DNA was drastically inhibited, there was no amplification in RAPD assay after prior exposure of DNA to UV-B for 60 min. Only one band of approximately 400 bp was observed even after 60 min of exposure which suggests that certain segment of DNA strand is resistant to UV-B effects. Similar to the effects on RAPD profile, amplification of rDNA was significantly inhibited following exposure of genomic DNA to UV-B. Our findings clearly demonstrate that UV-B does affect the DNA of cyanobacteria and the killings of these microbes might be due to the irreversible damages caused to DNA by this high energy radiation. It is felt that PCR assay may be conveniently used for screening the damages caused to DNA by UV-B radiation in cyanobacteria and other microorganisms. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The greater sensitivity of A. doliolum to test metals in semicontinuous culture was associated with their greater accumulation. The level of inhibition of various parameters of the test organism remained almost constant in semicontinuous culture, but considerable alleviation of the inhibitory effect occurred in batch Culture with time concomitant with a regular decline in metal content of cells. However, metal content of cells in semicontinuous Culture remained more or less constant with time, thereby causing no change in the level of inhibition. Unlike semicontinuous culture, batch culture showed considerable depletion of phosphate from the medium and a rise in pH (from 7 to 7.8). In conclusion, batch culture is not appropriate for long-term assessment of metal toxicity as it might substantially underestimate toxic effects of heavy metals. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

Hydrogen bonding interactions involving the drug molecules, DNA and the surrounding environment suggested in experimental studies earlier are mostly supported by the present MEP values. However, this study also reveals additional useful information in the sense that the calculated MEP values near the different atoms vary over a wide range indicating that the hydrogen bond strengths involving them would also vary appreciably. Occurrence of a strong binding of a Na+ ion to both O-4 and O-5 is indicated by the present MEP patterns. Further, the role of the binding of an oxygen atom that is present in adriamycin and but not in daunomycin and is associated with a large negative MEP value with DNA appears to be very important due to which the former drug is more effective as an anti-cancer agent than the latter.

A decrease in total PKA activity with a concomitant increase in the percentage of germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) was found in oocytes treated with different doses of N-(2-[p-bromocinnamylamino]ethyl)-5-isoquinoline sulfonamide (H-89), a selective, potent inhibitor of PKA and 17alpha,20beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17alpha,20beta-DP), the natural maturation-inducing steroid of this catfish. Evaluation of time-course of response to H-89 and 17alpha,20beta-DP revealed that PKA activity decreased, and incidence of GVBD increased at all the time points when compared with their respective controls. The data further indicate that the decrease in PKA activity in H-89-treated oocytes was more prominent, but the induction of maturation was slower than that induced by 17alpha,20beta-DP. Moreover, cyanoketone (CK), an inhibitor of steroidogenesis that blocks the salmon gonadotropin (SG-G100)-induced GVBD, failed to abolish the maturational effect of H-89, suggesting that H-89 directly promotes GVBD by reducing PKA activity in oocytes. Taken together, these results indicate that inhibition of PKA activity in the oocyte of C. batrachus is directly involved in the mechanism leading to oocyte maturation. J. Exp.

MP2/6-31 + G** single point calculations were carried out for all the complexes in the ground state. Excited states were generated using configuration interaction involving all the singly excited configurations (CIS) using the ground state optimized geometries and employing the 6-31 + G** basis set, and subsequently excited state geometries of the complexes were also optimized fully. The complex of water dimer with benzene (Bz-W-2) appears to be most stable among the various complexes. The lowest singlet electronic transition of benzene gets weakly allowed in the complexes. The calculated excitation energies show that small blue shifts would take place in the absorption spectra, particularly in going from benzene to the three higher complexes (Bz-W-n, n = 4-6). The geometry of Bz-W-4 is modified much more strongly due to excitation than those of the other complexes. The benzene ring gets expanded and the CH bond lengths are shortened in going from the ground to the excited states of all the complexes, as in a free benzene molecule. The HOH bond angles of the water molecules are increased, OH bond lengths are decreased and interatomic distances between the water molecules of W-n and those between the atoms of Bz and W-n are mostly increased due to excitation of the complexes. Thus, in each case, the water cluster W-n as well as the whole complex undergoes an expansion in size due to excitation. Thus excitation of the systems is not localized only on the benzene ring but is also extended to the water clusters. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This may cause diarrhoea on account of the possible bile acid malabsorption. To explore this possibility, the effect of high ambient temperature exposure on bile flow was studied in the warm acclimated albino rats. Methods: Following heat exposure at 38 +/- 0.5degreesC for 4 h/day, for up to 5 consecutive days, bile flow in the rats was measured gravimetrically under pentobarbital-induced anaesthesia, at steady rectal temperature (37 +/- 0.7degreesC), and flow characteristics and rate were studied. Results: The bile flow increased with the rise in rectal temperature (Tre) in an anaesthetized animal but, the relationship between the two was not linear; the flow nearly ceased if rectal temperature exceeded 43degrees-44degreesC. At steady, near normal, rectal temperature, bile flow showed fluctuations and, repetitive heat exposure led to a significant increase in bile flow. Interpretation & conclusion: Exposure to high ambient temperature modulates liver secretory function to. enhance bile flow rate and increase bile acid absorptive load on the small intestine, whose absorptive function is known to be adversely affected in heat stress.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Physiol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Sharma, RK (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Physiol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,1,MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS & MEDIA PVT LTD,MUMBAI,"B-9, KANARA BUSINESS CENTRE, OFF LINK RD, GHAKTOPAR-E, MUMBAI, 400075, INDIA",0971-5916,,,INDIAN J MED RES,Indian J.

Recently, we have reported the ability of T alpha1 to activate macrophages to tumoricidal state. In the present investigation, the activation of the p42/44 MAP kinase (MAPK)/c-Jun NH2 terminal kinase (JNK) pathway in response to in vitro treatment with T alpha1 in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) has been demonstrated. The activation and expression of phospho-p42/44 MAPK was dose as well as time dependent with maximum expression occurring at 5-15 min following stimulation with 100 ng/ml of T alpha1. The expression of phospho-p42/44 MAPK was inhibited by the MAPK inhibitor, PD98059, pertussis toxin (PTX), tyrosine kinase inhibitor-genistein and PI3K inhibitor-wortmannin. T alpha1-induced BMDM tumoricidal functions like the production of NO and TNF-alpha, the key mediator molecules of macrophage cytotoxicity, were also inhibited by the MAPK inhibitor, PD98059, in a dose-dependent manner. These observations suggest that p42/44 MAPK activation is one of the essential signaling events triggered by T alpha1 and may be responsible for the in vitro activation of BMDMs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Highest biosorption of Cu followed by Zn and Cd in single as well as in mixtures containing two or three metals was noticed. The order of inhibition of Cu, Zn and Cd biosorption in bi and trimetallic combinations was suggestive of screening or competition for the binding sites on the cell surface. This observation was reconfirmed by Freundlich adsorption isotherm. K-f values were maximum for Cu (K-f=45.18), followed by Zn (K-f=16.71), and Cd (K-f=15.63) in single metallic system. The K-f values for each test metal was reduced in solution containing more than one metal. Further, the reduction in biosorption of each metal ion due to presence of other metal ion was of greater magnitude at relatively higher concentrations of interfering metal ion. The biosorption of Cu at saturation was less affected when secondary metal (Cd or Zn) was added in the medium.

One structural form of each of 11-mer and 12-mer were also studied. The geometry optimization calculations were performed at the RHF/6-311G* level for all the cases and at the MP2/6-311++G** level for some selected cases. The optimized cluster geometries were used to calculate total energies of the clusters in gas phase employing the B3LYP density functional method and the 6-311G* basis set. Frequency analysis was carried out in all the cases to ensure that the optimized geometries corresponded to total energy minima. Zero-point and thermal free energy corrections were applied for comparison of energies of certain hexamers. The optimized cluster geometries were used to solvate the clusters in bulk water using the polarized continuum model (PCM) of the self-consistent reaction field (SCRF) theory, the 6-311G* basis set, and the B3LYP density functional method. For the cases for which MP2/6-311++G** geometry optimization was performed, solvation calculations in water were also carried out using the B3LYP density functional method, the 6-311++G** basis set, and the PCM model of SCRF theory, besides the corresponding gas-phase calculations. It is found that the cage form of water hexamer cluster is most stable in gas phase among the different hexamers, which is in agreement with the earlier theoretical and experimental results. Further, use of a newly defined relative population index (RPI) in terms of successive total energy differences per water molecule for different cluster sizes suggests that stabilities of trimers, hexamers, and nonamers in gas phase and those of hexamers and nonamers in bulk water would be favored while those of pentamer and decamer in both the phases would be relatively disfavored.

The selected area diffraction studies of the melt-spun ribbons of the above compositions have revealed the presence of streaking around some spots and also diffuse rows. These have led to the transformation of a basic P10(5)/mmc structure to that of P10/mmm having a periodicity of similar to8 Angstrom. Such a transformation has been explained based on the SD model earlier proposed by us. The chemical ordering in the layers is shown to accomplish the transformation.

Excited states were generated employing configuration interaction involving single electron excitations (CIS). Subsequently, the different species were solvated in water employing the self-consistent reaction field (SCRF) approach along with the corresponding gas phase optimized geometries. Thus the observed absorption and fluorescence spectra of adenine and 2AP have been explained successfully. It is concluded that both the N9H and N7H forms of 2AP would contribute to absorption and fluorescence spectra. Further, the fluorescence of 2AP would be absorbed by its cation in which both the N9 and N7 atoms are protonated, the fluorescence of which can have an anti-Stokes component. Among the different tautomers of adenine, the N9H form would be present dominantly in the ground state in aqueous solutions but the N7H form would be produced by energy transfer and subsequent fluorescence. The N3H form of adenine appears to be responsible for the observed absorption near 300 nm by its solutions intermittently exposed to ultraviolet radiation. The rings of the different species related to 2AP and adenine remain almost planar in the pi-pi* and n-pi* singlet excited states as in the ground state. The pyramidal character of the amino group is usually less in the pi-pi* excited states than that in the corresponding ground or n-pi* excited states. Molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps of the molecules provide useful clues regarding phototautomerism. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

It occupies a unique status among the Drosophila species due to certain peculiarities in its genetic behaviour and is of common occurrence in India. The most unusual feature of this species is spontaneous male meiotic recombination in appreciable frequency. The other unusual features are varied chromosomal polymorphism, high mutability, Y-4 linkage of nucleolus organizer, segregation, distortion, parthenogenesis, absence of genetic coadaptation in different geographical populations and extrachromosomal inheritance. The optic morphology (Om) hypermutability system is unique in D, ananassae and there is an involvement of tom retrotransposon for the generation of Om mutations. There is a positive correlation between sternopleural bristle number, mating propensity and fertility in D. ananassae. The existence of sexual isolation has been reported within D, ananassae and the degree of sexual isolation is stronger in isofemale lines than in natural populations, Behavioural studies also have revealed several interesting features in D, ananassae, A spontaneous bilateral genetic mosaic for autosomal genes resulting from mitotic recombination has been reported in D. ananassae, Another unusual feature attributed to D, ananassae is its pattern of chromosomal polymorphism. There are remarkably high levels of chromosomal polymorphism in natural populations. Although 70 paracentric inversions have been detected so far in this species, only three paracentric inversions (AL, DE, and ET) have become coextensive with the species. Most of the inversions have localized distribution and have been detected from a few individuals. Indian populations have undergone a considerable degree of genetic divergence at the level of inversion polymorphism, A large number of pericentric inversions and translocations which ordinarily do not exist in other species of Drosophila are present here.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Genet Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Singh, BN (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Genet Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",,,,,,,,143,39,41,0,6,CURRENT SCIENCE ASSN,BANGALORE,"C V RAMAN AVENUE, PO BOX 8005, BANGALORE 560 080, INDIA",0011-3891,,,CURR SCI INDIA,Curr.

The AM1 method was employed for the calculation of hydrogen bonding energies at the self-consistent field (SCF) level while atomic and hybridization displacement charges obtained by the same method were used to compute the electrostatic and polarization energies. It is found that hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, and polarization energies at different intermolecular distances vary with each other strongly linearly, and so the validity of the lock and key model of enzyme catalysis does not seem to be affected by electrical polarization of the enzyme and the substrate due to their hydrogen bonding. Lowest and highest surface molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) magnitudes near the hydrogen bond accepting and donating sites of the amino acids, respectively, are appreciably linearly related to the corresponding electrostatic interaction energies. Thus it is shown that MEP can be used as a reliable descriptor of hydrogen bonding. However, when more than one hydrogen bond is formed in a given region of a molecule, particularly when a cyclic structure is produced due to hydrogen bonding, only the MEP values near the hydrogen bond accepting and donating atoms would not be sufficient to describe hydrogen bonding reliably.

Nuclei purified from different groups of mice were digested with MNase and DNase I for varying time periods (0-90 min), and with endogenous endonucleases for 1 h. MNase and DNase I digestion kinetics showed that the percentage of acid solubility of chromatin was relatively lower in old than adult and in female than male. This was further supported by electrophoretic analysis of nuclease digested DNA fragments. When the nuclei were incubated with only Ca2+ or mg(2+), no endonuclease digestion was observed. However, under similar conditions, the liver DNA was cleaved substantially. When divalent cations were added together, they activated endogenous endonucleases and digested the brain chromatin. The activity of Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent endogenous endonucleases was higher in male than female. Thus the accessibility of chromatin to MNase, DNase I and endogenous endonucleases was higher in male than female, and MNase as well as DNase I were more active in adult than old. Such sex- and age-dependent conformation of chromatin may attribute to differential expression of genes in the mouse brain.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Adv Study Bot, Biochem & Mol Biol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Thakur, MK (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Adv Study Bot, Biochem & Mol Biol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",,,,,,,,46,4,4,0,5,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0301-4851,,,MOL BIOL REP,Mol.

The nanostructured TiO2 photoelectrode was prepared by the hydrolysis of titanium-tetraisopropoxide followed by deposition of thin film by spin coating. To prepare the TiO2(ns) VO2 photoelectrode, vanadium film was deposited on the TiO2(ns) film and subsequently oxidized in O-2 ambient. The TiO2(ns)-VO2 photoelectrode exhibited enhanced photovoltage and photocurrent of 680 mV and 11.0 mA cm(-2), respectively, whereas the TiO2(ns) presented 540 mV and 3.2 mA cm(-2) respectively. X-ray and S.E.M studies were carried out to monitor the surface and bulk characteristics of the TiO2(ns)VO2 photoelectrode. The rate of hydrogen production under photoelectrolysis was found to be 6 1 h(-1) m(-2) for the TiO2(ns) and similar to 13.01 h(-1) m(-2) for the TiO2(ns)-VO2 photoelectrode. The TiO2(ns) photoelectrode shows the improvement in the PEC characteristics due to higher quantum yield resulting from the structured nature of the material. The PEC improvement in the TiO2(ns)VO2 photoelectrode is due to the increase of range of absorption and the decrease of energy gap. (C) 1999 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

Annual litterfall varied from 1220 kg ha(-1) in the S. robusta stand to 3620 kg ha(-1) in the A. indica stand. The fast-growing species A. indica and D, sissoo exhibited higher litter production in comparison to the other two slow-growing species. The total N returned to the soil through litterfall ranged from 8.6 kg ha(-1) year(-1) in the S. robusta stand to 36.5 kg ha(-1) year(-1) in the D. sissoo stand. The annual percent leaf litter mass loss was distinctly greater in A. indica (73%) and D. sissoo (69%) in comparison to P. pinatta (59%) and S. robusta (47%). The mean relative decomposition rates of leaf litter material were maximum in the rainy season and minimum in summer. Rainfall and its associated variables exhibited greater control over litter decomposition than temperature. Lignin and water-soluble compounds were better predictors of annual mass loss rates accounting for 90% variability. Mass loss was positively correlated with N and P mineralization rates. Lignin was the best predictor of annual N and P mineralization rates. Nutrient release pattern differed; constant release occurred in A. indica, initial release followed by delayed immobilization and release occurred in D. sissoo and P. pinnata, and initial immobilization followed by gradual release was noticed in S. robusta. A. indica and D. sissoo, showing high litterfall and rapid litter decomposition rate, hold promise for the rehabilitation of nutrient-poor coal mine spoils. On the other hand, S. robusta with less litterfall and a slow decomposition rate may prove disadvantageous.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Adv Study Bot, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Singh, KP (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Adv Study Bot, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",,"Singh, K P/B-3678-2013; Tripathi, Shri Kant/F-4974-2012",,,,,,36,74,116,2,41,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0178-2762,,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

The recruitment of culm population varied between 18% and 36% and shoot mortality from 6-7% per year. Net accumulation of preen culms during 3rd and 4th year was 3999 and between 4th and 5th year 10854 ha(-1). Total biomass was 46.9 t ha(-1) in the 3-year old to 74.7 t ha(-1) in the 5-year old plantation with 35% occurring belowground. Total net primary production (NPP) ranged between 20.7 t ha(-1) (3-year old) and 32.0 t ha(-1) (5-year old), of which aboveground net production was 17.0 to 24.7 t ha(-1) (between 3 to 4, and 4 to 5 years, respectively). Accounting for only 14% of the total biomass, foliage contributed 36% to NPP. Nutrient deposition through leaf litter was 45-79 kg N and 6-11 kg P ha(-1). Litter bag experiment indicated 235 days for 50% and more than 1000 days for 95% decomposition. Amounts of N and P deposition and release increased with the age of the plantation. Rate of N-mineralization increased from 3.3 (3 years) to 6.9 mu g g(1) month(-1) (5 years). The proportion of mineralized-N converted into nitrate decreased with age. Soil microbial C increased from 127-319, microbial-N from 19-38 and microbial-P from 9-16 mu g g(-1) soil between 3 to 5 years. With increasing age of plantation, a greater proportion of soil C, N and P tended to be immobilized in soil microbial biomass.

The increase of sorptive concentration (10(-8) to 10(-2) mol dm(-3)), temperature (293-323 K) and pH (ca. 3 to 10) favoured the removal process of these ions; but in the case of Hg2+ on Neem bark, there was seemingly no temperature effect. The uptake process follows first order rate law and obeys the Freundlich adsorption isotherm. Added anions and cations in the bulk solution inhibit to some extent the removal of these toxic ions. Similarly the inhibition in the uptake was also observed when both biomasses were irradiated by neutron and gamma-rays prior to being employed as sorbents.

Basis set dependence of all the four contributing terms has been studied in order to find the criterion for the selection of basis sets to be employed for computing this property. The dependence of the coupling constants of PH2- on its geometry has also been found. This study also discusses the requirement for satisfactory computation of couplings in cases where none of the coupling nuclei is a proton. It is found that bond-centred functions along with at least double zeta basis sets reproduce coupling constants quite satisfactorily. In all the cases studied, uncontracted core basis functions yield couplings which are in better agreement with experimental couplings than those obtained with contracted core functions.

The symphysis to fundus (S-F) distance was measured in early labour and was plotted against the birth weight of the newborns. A significant positive correlation was observed between the two parameters (r = +0.740). For the prediction of LBW, the critical limit of the fundal height was 31 cm, meaning that a S-F distance of more than 31 cm is reasonably safe while lesser values predict a higher chalice of a LBW infant. From these observations, the use of a colour-coded tape by peripheral health workers and traditional birth attendants is suggested: red for S-F <28 cm, yellow for S-F = 28-31 cm, and green for S-F >31 cm, Mothers who have a fundal height in the 'red zone' are at risk of delivering LBW infants.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Anat, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Pediat, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Das, BK (corresponding author), H-26,BDA Flats,Rabindrapuri Extens,BHU PO, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",,,,,,,,3,4,5,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6338,,,J TROP PEDIATRICS,J.

The shelf-life of the enzyme on storage in 0.1 M Tris-acetate buffer, pH 6.5, at -10 degrees C showed a single exponential decay with a t(1/2) of approx. 30 days. In the presence of additives like 5mM dithiothreitol the t(1/2) increased to 223 days at the same temperature, in a single exponential decay. The Arrhenius plot of the kinetics of the pigeonpea urease catalysed urea hydrolysis over the temperature range 27 to 77 degrees C, was linear. The Q(10) value was found to be 1.46. The energy of activation calculated from the Arrhenius equation was found to be 5.1 kcal/mole active site. The thermal denaturation of pigeopea urease at 65 and 70 degrees C was found to obey biphasic kinetics in which half of the activity is destroyed faster than the remaining half. The time course of thermal inactivation can be described by the following equation, consisting of two first order terms: A(t) = A(fast).e(-k)fast(-t) + A(slow.e)(-k)slow(.t) where, A(t) is the residual activity at time t, A(fast) and A(slow), k(fast) and k(slow) are the amplitudes and the first-order rate constants of the fast and the slow phases, respectively.

Flux from the irrigated rice paddies was in the range 2.14-8.23 mg CH(4)m(-2)h(-1) during the crop period. In contrast, the dryland rice soil consumed 0.12-0.90 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1). Application of wheat straw + fertilizer stimulated CH4 production in irrigated rice soil while it reduced CH4 consumption in dryland rice plots. CH4 flux measurements from nutrient-poor, well-drained dry deciduous forest and savanna soils indicated heavy methane consumption. Maximum CH4 consumption was observed during the winter season (0.46-0.95 mg CH4 m(-1) h(-1)) at all the sites and was lowest during the rainy season (0.17-0.32 mg CH4 m(-1) h(-1)). The results suggest that dryland rice soils and natural ecosystems ate potential sinks of CH4. Conservative extrapolation of the results indicates that to compensate for CH4 production from 1 ha of irrigated rice about 2.4 ha of natural ecosystems are needed. Thus there is a need of further evaluation of the role of tropical dryland rice soils and naturally dry ecosystems in the global methane budget. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The UVB-induced inhibition of 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) photoreduction and lowering of chlorophyll a fluorescence could not be reversed by artificial electron donors (diphenyl carbazide, NH2OH and MnCl2). These electron donors, however, substantially reversed the inhibition caused by Pb, thereby suggesting that UVB primarily inhibits the photosystem II (PS II) reaction center and Pb arrests the electron flow at the water splitting site, Nevertheless, the suppressed fluorescence intensity and the reduced emission and excitation peaks of phycobilisomes indicate the involvement of Pb in inhibition of PS II, All combinations of UVB and Pb inhibited the different metabolic processes in a synergistic manner.","BANARAS HINDU UNIV,DEPT BOT,ALGAL BIOL LAB,VARANASI 221005,UTTAR PRADESH,INDIA",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),,,"Tyagi, Bhudeva/AAR-8225-2021","Mallick, Nirupama/0000-0002-9969-0464",,,,,37,11,15,0,4,AMER SOC PHOTOBIOLOGY,AUGUSTA,"BIOTECH PARK, 1021 15TH ST, SUITE 9, AUGUSTA, GA 30901-3158",0031-8655,,,PHOTOCHEM PHOTOBIOL,Photochem.

Corresponding shoot mortality was 66-93% and 62-69%, respectively. Total biomass was 34.9 t ha(-1) at the harvested site and 47.4 t ha(-1) at the mature site. Harvesting increased the relative contribution of belowground bamboo biomass.

The mean litter mass on the savanna floor ranged from 3.1 to 3.3 t ha(-1); at the harvested site wood litter contributed 70% of the litter mass and at the mature site leaves formed 77% of the litter mass.

The data have been discussed with respect to the effect of the coenzymes on the quaternary structure symmetry of the two enzymes and their binding isotherms. Both the (homo-tetrameric) apo-enzymes exhibit biphasic kinetics of thermal inactivation, characteriStiC of C2 symmetry, at lower pH values and a single exponential decay of enzyme activity, characteristic of D2 symmetry, at higher pHs. In each case, NAD+ has no effect on the biphasic kinetic pattern of thermal inactivation at lower pH values, but NADH brings about a change to single exponential decay. At higher pH values, NADH does not affect the kinetic pattern (single exponential decay) of any enzyme, but NAD+ alters it to biphasic kinetics in each case. The data suggest that NAD+ and NADH have higher affinity for the C2 and D2 symmetry conformation, respectively. With mung beans enzyme, the effect of NAD+ on the two rate constants of biphasic inactivation at pH 7.3 is consistent with a K(diss) equal to 110 muM. The NAD+-dependent changes in the kinetic pattern of thermal inactivation of this enzyme at pH 8.6 suggest a positive cooperativity in the coenzyme binding (n(H) = 3.0). In the binding of NADH to the mung beans enzyme, a weak positive cooperativity is observed at pH 7.3. With rabbit muscle enzyme, NADH binding at pH 9.0 is consistent with the presence of two types of binding sites with K(diss) equal to 0.07 and 0.5 mM. Binding of successive molecules of NAD+ to rabbit muscle enzyme brings about a decrease followed by an increase and again a decrease in the two rate constants of biphasic thermal inactivation. Binding of the first two NAD+ molecules appears to be stoichiometric with K(diss) not larger than 2 x 10(-8) M. Subsequent coenzyme molecules bind with a lesser affinity.","BANARAS HINDU UNIV,SCH BIOTECHNOL,VARANASI 221005,UTTAR PRADESH,INDIA",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"MALHOTRA, OP (corresponding author), BANARAS HINDU UNIV,DEPT CHEM & BIOCHEM,VARANASI 221005,UTTAR PRADESH,INDIA.",,,"Tikoo, Kulbhushan/0000-0003-3061-9739; Kayastha, Arvind M./0000-0002-5090-7159",,,,,37,7,7,0,2,COUNCIL SCIENTIFIC INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH,NEW DELHI,"PUBL & INFO DIRECTORATE, NEW DELHI 110012, INDIA",0301-1208,,,INDIAN J BIOCHEM BIO,Indian J.

The layer was deformed up to 21 per cent bulk-shortening under an initial confining-stress of 1 kb and at a strain rate of 7.95 X 10(-7)sec-1. The deformed layer exhibits the initial stages of ptygmatic folding. The stress-strain and time-strain relationships have been discussed. Thin-section study of the deformed layer reveals that recrystallisation of cryptocrystalline silica was the dominant mechanism of deformation.

The application of the theory to the freezing of various simple and complex fluids is discussed. The theory has demonstrated that classical fluids freeze when they are strongly correlated, as evidenced by the pair correlation function. In the freezing of quantum fluids, the self-correlation function is found to play an important role. Some of the transitions discussed in this article are sensitive to the form of the direct correlation functions of the co-existing or effective liquid, which is used as input information in the theory. The need for knowing these correlations accurately. particularly in the case of molecular fluids, is emphasized. The application of the density-functional formulation to the general situation where the density is neither uniform, as in a liquid, nor periodic, as in the crystal, is discussed. The problems discussed are the solid-melt interface, nucleation of a solid in a supercooled melt and dislocations. The importance of the density-functional formulation in describing properties of crystals and liquid crystals including elasticity, flexoelectricity, surface layering and wetting transitions have been shown.

The seasonal variation of six nutrients (NO3--N, PO4--P, K, Ca, Mg, Na) in water is described and their mean concentrations used in multiple regression equations to examine the relationship between nutrients in water, plant biomass and nutrient accumulation in plant body. Hydrilla verticillata (L.f.) Royle, Potamogeton crispus L., P. pectinatus L. and Aponogeton natans (L.) Engle and Krause are the constituent species. Plants show rapid growth in post-monsoon and pre-winter months. All the four species showed biomass accumulation in the rainy season. The highest rate of production in the submerged zone was 0.73 g m-2 d-1 and the minimum was 0.29 g m-2 d-1. Maximum annual production of any species was 69 g m-2 in P. pectinatus. In all the four species the nutrient concentration decreased in the following order: calcium > nitrogen > potassium > magnesium > sodium > phosphorus. Seasonal variation of nutrient content was dependent on the period of germination, growth and development of the species. Nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium were higher in the season of growth of particular species and calcium was higher when plants matured. There was no definite trend for sodium, though magnesium varied with species. Uptake and accumulation of nutrients in submerged plants largely depend upon nutrient concentration of water, except nitrogen which was also dependent on biomas change. Sources of nutrient for plants are both sediment and water.

As AMPK-alpha 2 knockout mice exhibit impaired thrombus stability, we asked whether pharmacological inhibition of AMPK with a specific small-molecule inhibitor, compound C, could protect against arterial thrombosis without affecting hemostasis. Mice pre-administered with compound C exhibited decreased mesenteric arteriolar thrombosis but normal tail bleeding time compared to vehicle-treated animals. Compound C potently restricted platelet aggregation, clot retraction and integrin activation induced by thrombin and collagen. It impaired platelet spreading on both immobilized fibrinogen and collagen matrices; it, however, had no significant effect on thrombin-induced phosphatidylserine exposure that is characteristic of procoagulant platelets. In parallel, compound C brought about significant drop in thrombin-induced phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) and MLC phosphatase (MYPT1) as well as abrogated rise in level of RhoA-GTP in thrombin-stimulated platelets. Thus, effects of compound C on agonist-induced platelet responses could be at least in part attributed to modulation of cytoskeletal changes mediated by RhoA-MYPT1-MLC signaling. An ideal antithrombotic drug would spare hemostatic responses that maintain vascular integrity while preferentially protecting against thrombosis. The present study suggests that AMPK could be one such potential therapeutic target.","[Kulkarni, Paresh P.; Sonkar, Vijay K.; Gautam, Deepa; Dash, Debabrata] Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Adv Res Platelet Signaling & Thrombosis Biol, Inst Med Sci, Dept Biochem, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Sonkar, Vijay K.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Dash, D (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Biochem, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",ddash.biochem@gmail.com,"Kulkarni, Paresh P/AAB-3190-2019; DASH, DEBABRATA/AAF-1837-2020","Kulkarni, Paresh P/0000-0002-9108-0485; dash, Debabrata/0000-0001-7291-2453","JC Bose fellowship; Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) under CAR, Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), Government of India","JC Bose fellowship(Department of Science & Technology (India)); Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) under CAR, Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), Government of India","This work was supported by a JC Bose fellowship and grants received by D.

This study has shown that removal of endophytic bacteria from millet seeds compromised seedling health, however, re-inoculation of the same bacterial isolates restored its growth. A total of six endophytic bacteria were isolated from surface-sterilized seeds of finger millet and molecularly identified by 16S rDNA sequencing as Paenibacillus dendritiformis (EC1), Enterobacter hormaechei (EC2), Enterobacter cloacae (EC3), Bacillus safensis (EC4), Enterobacter hormaechei (EC5), and Enterobacter hormaechei (EC6). These isolated endophytes were tested for their plant growth-promoting activities. Enterobacter strains (EC2, EC3, EC5 and EC6) were found positive for IAA (Indole acetic acid) test and showed phosphate as well as potassium solubilization activities while siderophore production was shown by EC1 and EC4. Antifungal activity was also evaluated with isolate EC1 showing inhibition against all the tested phytopathogens. In seedling protection assay, bacterial endophytes significantly reduced the infection from Fusarium oxysporum. Re-inoculation experiment was carried out and it was found that bacterial strains EC1, EC4, and EC5 were most active in seedling development of finger millet, showing considerable improvement in root-shoot lengths, fresh weights and content of chlorophyll pigments.

Herein, we report a novel strategy for the synthesis of sulfur-doped mesoporous conducting carbon nitride supported defect-rich cobalt sulfide (O-Co3S4@S-MCN). Mesoporous silica material (MCM-41) is used as a template for the synthesis, and it performs dual functions: introducing porosity and providing in situ oxygen to fill the defects. O-Co3S4@S-MCN is highly crystalline and shows characteristic diffractions indicating the formation of defect-rich Co3S4. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy proves the presence of Co-S (777.9 eV) and Co-O (782.4 eV) bonds in O-Co3S4@S-MCN. Further, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy clearly indicates the presence of C.N (1620 cm(-1)) and C.S (1090 cm(-1)) bonds. This composite material, OCo3S4@S-MCN, shows a low onset potential (1.6 V for 10 mA cm(-2)), high mass activity (71 A/g at 1.7 V), high rate (Tafel slope, 52 mV/dec), and excellent stability (only 5% decrease in current density after 2 h continuous electrolysis) for the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction in 1.0 M KOH.","[Singh, Devesh Kumar; Ganesan, Vellaichamy; Yadav, Dharmendra Kumar; Yadav, Mamta] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Chem, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Ganesan, V (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Chem, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",velganesh@yahoo.com,"Ganesan, Vellaichamy/C-7529-2012","Ganesan, Vellaichamy/0000-0002-5241-5350","DST-SAEAN program [IMRC/AISTDF/RD/P-16/2018]; CSIR, New Delhi","DST-SAEAN program; CSIR, New Delhi(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India)","Financial support from DST-SAEAN program (IMRC/AISTDF/R&D/P-16/2018) is acknowledged.

With advances in neuroimaging and changing lifestyles, the clinical profile and causes of CVT are changing. D-dimer has been studied in early diagnosis of CVT with variable results. This prospective study was carried out to assess the clinical profile of CVT and role of D-dimer in early diagnosis of CVT. The study period was from September 2017 to July 2019 and included 32 imaging proven patients of CVT. We also included 32 patients of migraine for assessing D-dimer. Data was collected according to a preformed format. D-dimer was assessed by a rapid semi-quantitative latex agglutination assay. Out of 32 CVT patients, 16(50%) were females. The mean age of the patients was 31.56 +/- 14.31 years. Most common clinical features were headache (96.25%), papilloedema (37.5%) and seizures 10 (31.25%). Puerperium was the most common cause of CVT in females. Superior sagittal and transverse sinuses were the most common sinuses to be affected. The sensitivity of D-dimer assay was 81.25% and specificity 62.5%. Cerebral venous thrombosis is a disease with equal predilection among both genders affecting mostly young individuals. Most of the patients present with headache. Puerperium still contributes to majority of the cases. Iron deficiency anaemia needs to be evaluated as an association for CVT. Positive D-dimer should strengthen the suspicion of CVT in patients with acute headache. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Estimation of model parameters of ore bodies in the subsurface is the primary concern in mineral exploration. In most cases, self-potential data are delineated considering various simple or idealized structures for the interpretation of lateral and vertical variations of subsurface ore bodies. In this context, we developed an inversion algorithm to determine the different parameters associated with a 2D inclined plate-type structure, which does not require any a priori information. The developed algorithm can interpret appropriately every parameter with minimum uncertainty. The position of causative source body (x(0)), its half-width (w) and its depth (z) were the parameters interpreted using the developed algorithm. It was found that these parameters were well resolved within the estimated uncertainty, although solutions forwshowed wide variability. The technique was verified with synthetic data without noise and with different degrees of Gaussian noise. The technique was also confirmed with three field datasets for mineral exploration, and the interpreted parameters were in fair agreement with those reported in earlier works.","[Rao, Khushwant; Jain, Shraddha; Biswas, Arkoprovo] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Ctr Adv Study, Dept Geol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Biswas, A (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Ctr Adv Study, Dept Geol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",arkoprovo@gmail.com,,"Biswas, Arkoprovo/0000-0003-2106-9587","Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), New Delhi","Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), New Delhi(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India)","We would like to thank the Editor-in-Chief Prof. John Carranza and two anonymous reviewers for their comments, which have helped to improve the work.

Neurological disorders like PD can be modelled in animals so as to recapitulates most of the symptoms seen in PD patients. In aging population, PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease, even though significant outcomes have been achieved in PD research yet it still is a mystery to solve the treatments for PD. In the last two decades, PD models have provided enhanced precision into the understanding of the process of PD disease, its etiology, pathology, and molecular mechanisms behind it. Furthermore, at the same time as cellular models have helped to recognize specific events, animal models, both toxic and genetic, have replicated almost all of the hallmarks of PD and are very helpful for testing and finding new strategies for neuroprotection. Recently, in both classical and newer models, major advances have been done in the modelling of supplementary PD features have come into the light In this review, we have try to provide an updated summary of the characteristics of these models related to in vitro and in vivo models, animal models for PD, stem cell model for PD, newer 3D model as well as the strengths and limitations of these most popular PD models.","[Rai, Sachchida Nand; Singh, Payal] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Zool, Mahila Maha Vidhyalaya, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Rai, SN (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Biochem, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",raibiochem@gmail.com; payalsingh200012@gmail.com,"Rai, Sachchida Nand Nand/K-5764-2019","Rai, Sachchida Nand Nand/0000-0001-8418-9549",,,,,259,46,46,2,19,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0891-0618,1873-6300,,J CHEM NEUROANAT,J.

So, identification and characterization of such proteins is essential for understanding tuberculosis pathogenesis. The role of the ABC transporter proteins in the pathophysiology and virulence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is not clearly understood. In the present study, Rv1273c, an ABC transporter, has been expressed in a non-pathogenic and fast growing Mycobacterium smegmatis strain to explore its role in host pathogen interactions. Over expression of Rv1273c resulted in enhanced intracellular survival in macrophage as well as modified cell wall architecture. We found altered colony morphology and cell surface properties that might be linked with remodelling of bacterial cell wall which may help in the intracellular survival of mycobacterium. However, the enhanced intracellular survival was not found to be the consequence of an increased resistance to intracellular stresses. The activation of macrophage by Rv1273c was associated with perturbed cytokine production. Pharmacological inhibition experiment and western immunoblotting suggested that this altered cytokine profile was mediated possibly by NF-kB and p38 pathway in macrophage. Overall, the present findings indicated that Rv1273c enhanced mycobacterium persistence and mediated the evasion of immune responses during infection. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Materials and Methods: A total of 50 CML cases and 10 acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cases along with 20 healthy controls were included in the study between 2015 and 2016. About 4 mL blood samples were collected from all cases in plain vial and serum was separated. Levels of IL6 were determined in all cases by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The study suggests that both ALL and CML are associated with significantly elevated serum IL6 level than the healthy control group. Mean levels of serum IL6 are 223.4 +/- 53.403 pg/mL in CML, 71.020 +/- 29.549 pg/mL in ALL, and 5.360 +/- 0.467 pg/mL in healthy control group. Serum IL6 correlated with different phases of CML. Mean IL6 levels are 50.93 +/- 29.37 pg/mL in chronic phase (CP), 69.02 +/- 22.60 pg/mL in accelerated phase (AP), and 652.77 +/- 124.62 pg/mL in blast crisis (BC) phase of CML. In compared to CP and AP, in BC, IL-6 is significantly elevated ( P = 0.00 and 0.00, respectively); however, we did not find a significant difference in IL-6 serum levels between CP and AP ( P = 0.703). Conclusion: Study suggests that the detection of IL6 level in newly diagnosed patient can predict the severity of the disease. There might be association of level of IL6 with the disease transformation.","[Sharma, Kavyanjali; Shukla, Jyoti; Kumar, Sandip] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Pathol, Inst Med Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Rai, Madhukar] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Med, Inst Med Sci, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Singh, Usha] Banaras Hindu Univ, UGC Adv Immunodiagnost Training & Res Ctr, Inst Med Sci, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Gupta, Vineeta] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Pediat, Sir Sundarlal Hosp, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Narayan, Gopeshwar] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Sharma, K (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Pathol, Inst Med Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",kavyanjali85@gmail.com,,,"UGC Advanced Imunodiagnostic Training and Research Centre (UGC AITRC), New Delhi; Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), New Delhi","UGC Advanced Imunodiagnostic Training and Research Centre (UGC AITRC), New Delhi; Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), New Delhi(Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR))","We are thankful to the UGC Advanced Imunodiagnostic Training and Research Centre (UGC AITRC) and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), New Delhi for financial support.",,23,0,0,0,1,WOLTERS KLUWER MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS,MUMBAI,"WOLTERS KLUWER INDIA PVT LTD , A-202, 2ND FLR, QUBE, C T S  NO 1498A-2 VILLAGE MAROL, ANDHERI EAST, MUMBAI, Maharashtra, INDIA",0973-1482,1998-4138,,J CANCER RES THER,J.

Patients on multidrug resistance (MDR) treatment are monitored by follow up cultures. Discordant results (culture and smear positive while capilia negative) are usually declared negative Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC). This study was designed to understand the possible causes of discordant results. Methods: The capilia kit was evaluated to test its utility among 4737 follow up MDR patients enrolled during a period of 1 year. A total of 889 were liquid culture positive, 3375 were negative and 473 were contaminated. Of the 889 cultures positive, 829 were found positive by ZN smear, capilia test and MTBDR plus assay. The cultures which gave a positive result on Mycobacterium Growth Indicator Tube 960 (MGIT 960) and ZN smear but were negative on capilia test with no growth on Brain Heart Infusion agar (BHI) were included in this study. The conflicting results of capilia were compared with other molecular techniques; MTBDR plus assay and DNA sequence analysis of MPT64 gene. Results: Out of 889 culture positive, 60 (6.7%) were found positive on liquid culture and ZN smear but were negative on capilia. Of these 60 cultures, 10 (16.7%) were found positive by both MTBDR plus assay and PCR. The sequencing analysis revealed that all of the capilia negative isolates had mutations within the MPT64 gene. Conclusion: Re-evaluation of culture positive but capilia negative isolates should be done before declaring them as Mycobacterium other than tuberculosis (MOTT) because such cases can act as chronic carriers of TB in the population which can lead to the rise of this lethal disease.","[Singh, Kamal; Kumari, Richa; Tripathi, Rajneesh; Anupurba, Shampa] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Microbiol, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Gupta, Ankush] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Biochem, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Anupurba, S (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Microbiol, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India.",shampa_anupurba@yahoo.co.in,,"SINGH, KAMAL/0000-0002-0984-6630; Gupta, Ankush/0000-0001-7575-3187; Anupurba, Shampa/0000-0002-7644-1086",,,,,22,7,8,0,1,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1471-2334,,BMC INFECT DIS,BMC Infect.

ATRP of styrene has successfully been carried out in a control manner using these initiators along with catalyst/ligand system consisting of Cu(I)Br/N,N,N-/,N-/,N-//-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine. Polymerizations have yielded polystyrenes (PSts) of controlled molecular weight with low polydispersity index having a menthyl end group, as confirmed by H-1 NMR and gel permeation chromatography [GPC]. The controlled nature of the polymerization has also been confirmed by kinetic study of the polymerization process monitored via H-1 NMR and GPC. Initiator 2 has evolved as most efficient among the two. The obtained end-functional PSt has also been used as a macroinitiator for homochain extension with styrene and heterochain extension with methyl methacrylate to produce PSt-b-PMMA, showing the living nature of the polymerization process. In comparison with the PSt sample prepared using widely used initiator ethyl-2-bromo-isobutyrate with almost the same molecular weight and polydispersity, initiator 2-made L-menthyl-capped PSt has shown higher light transmission properties of its dichloromethane solution at 259nm, higher thermal stability, lower glass transition temperature, a broad melting temperature, and higher surface roughness over its film.

Leishman Giemsa (LG) cocktail, being a relatively new staining technique, has not been used in exfoliative cytology. The aim of this study is to observe and compare the micronuclei (MN) frequency in potentially malignant disorders (PMDs) and also to compare the staining efficacy of May-Grunwald Giemsa (MGG), LG cocktail, and Papanicolaou (PAP) for micronuclei in exfoliated oral mucosal cells. Materials and Methods: Three smears were prepared from each 30 controls (buccal mucosa) and 120 patients (40 oral submucous fibrosis, 40 lichen planus, and 40 leukoplakia) clinically diagnosed with having one of the PMDs of the oral cavity stained with PAP, MGG, and LG cocktail stains. MN frequency (No. of MN/1000 cells) was evaluated and compared between the cases and the controls. Comparison between the three different stained smears was also made to determine the clarity and efficacy of the stains. Results: LG cocktail gave comparatively better results followed by PAP and MGG. Statistically significant results (P < 0.05) were obtained, using MannuWhitney test for comparison of MN frequency between cases and controls. Conclusion: LG cocktail is an easy, cost- effective, and one step technique comparable to PAP staining; however, it warrants further study in its potential application in screening of oral cancer.","[Gupta, Jatin] BHU, Dept Oral Med & Radiol, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Gupta, Kanupriya; Agarwal, Rahul] BHU, Fac Dent Sci, IMS, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Gupta, K (corresponding author), BHU, Fac Dent Sci, IMS, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",drkanupriya12@gmail.com,,,,,,,31,5,6,0,0,WOLTERS KLUWER MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS,MUMBAI,"WOLTERS KLUWER INDIA PVT LTD , A-202, 2ND FLR, QUBE, C T S  NO 1498A-2 VILLAGE MAROL, ANDHERI EAST, MUMBAI, 400059, INDIA",0973-1482,1998-4138,,J CANCER RES THER,J.

Objective: This study aims to see the effect of bacteriophage therapy in chronic nonhealing wound infected with the following bacteria: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Subject: Patients with chronic nonhealing wound not responding to conventional local debridement and antibiotic therapy were included in the study. The age of patients ranged between 12 and 60 years. Method: A total of 20 patients selected and tissue biopsies and wound swabs were taken for isolation of the bacteria. After confirmation of organism, a cocktail of customized bacteriophages was topically applied over the wound on alternate days till the wound surface became microbiologically sterile. Mean bacterial count and clinical assessment were done and compared at the time of presentation and after 3 and 5 doses of application. Results: A significant improvement was observed in the wound healing, and there were no signs of infection clinically and microbiologically after 3 to 5 doses of topical bacteriophage therapy.

Twelve leaf functional traits were assessed on eight most dominant herbaceous species belonging to four angiospermic families in three different land uses with varying air pollution loads and soil properties. Particulate matter (PM10 and TSP), gaseous pollutants (SO2, NO2, and O-3), land uses (built-up area, shrub, and grass cover), and soil properties showed significant variability among the land uses. Air pollution was identified as the major stress factor which influenced leaf functional traits of ground cover vegetation followed by soil properties and land uses. Among the plants, Croton sparsiflorus was found to be the most responsive plants to all the factors. Plants responded differently under varying environmental factors as Euphorbia hirta was maximally influenced by air pollution, whereas the effect of land use was maximum in C. sparsiflorus. Influence of soil properties was highest in Digitaria ciliaris and Scoparia dulcis. All the environmental factors in combination maximally influenced non-enzymatic antioxidants (ascorbic acid and polyphenolics) followed by photosynthetic pigments among the different leaf functional traits. Among the environmental factors, NO2 and PM were identified as the most influencing factors regulating leaf functional traits followed by K level in soil and shrub cover. It can be concluded that responses of different leaf functional traits of ground cover vegetation varied with different environmental factors and responses were mostly species specific.","[Mukherjee, Arideep; Agrawal, Madhoolika] Banaras Hindu Univ, Lab Air Pollut & Global Climate Change, Dept Bot, Inst Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Agrawal, M (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Lab Air Pollut & Global Climate Change, Dept Bot, Inst Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",arideep@gmail.com; madhoo.agrawal@gmail.com,"Mukherjee, Arideep/V-7595-2019",,"Department of Science and Technology (DST), India [IF120768]","Department of Science and Technology (DST), India(Department of Science & Technology (India))","We thank the head of Department of Botany, Center of Advanced Study (CAS), Banaras Hindu University, and the coordinators of CAS and Department of Science and Technology-Fund for Improvement of Science & Technology Infrastructure in Higher Educational Institutions (DST-FIST) and DST-PURSE (Promotion of University Research and Scientific Excellence) for providing necessary laboratory and central instrumental facilities for the research work.

The DDCS spectra of BS photons were recorded using a Si-PIN photodiode detector in the energy range of 2.0-3.8 keV and angular detection range of 45-120 degrees relative to the incident beam direction of electrons. The measured angular distribution of BS photons suggests that the radiation emerging from the considered electron -molecule collisions is anisotropic and its relative magnitude depends on the energy of emitted photons. The experimental DDCS spectra of CH4 are compared with DDCS spectra calculated from the atomic field bremsstrahlung formulations of Kissel - Quarles Pratt (KQP) using additivity hypothesis. A good agreement is observed between the measured DDCS of CH4 molecule and those obtained from KQP theory. The anisotropy of the radiation, that is, its angular asymmetry is found to compare reasonably well with the predictions of KQP. The anisotropy of the dipole radiation as often defined by a polarisation parameter P (or degree of polarisation) is found to vary from (29.0 +/- 9)% to (70.0 +/- 9)% for photons with energy ranging from 2.0 keV to 3.8 keV, respectively.","[Prajapati, Suman; Singh, Bhupendra; Singh, B.

His extensive work on D. pseudoobscura has revealed interesting phenomena of population genetics. In continuation of his work on this species, he constructed a number of homozygous lines for different gene arrangements in the third chromosome, and while employing these lines in intrapopulation and interpopulation crosses, he quantified the fitness of inversion homokaryotypes and heterokaryotypes. Interestingly, his results showed that heterokaryotypes formed by chromosomes originating from the same geographic area exhibited superiority over the corresponding homokaryotypes. However, superiority of heterokaryotypes was lost in the crosses when chromosomes were derived from different localities. Based on these results, Dobzhansky suggested the concept of genetic coadaptation. According to this concept, 'in each locality, the chromosomes with different gene arrangements are mutually adjusted or coadapted to yield highly fit inversion heterozygotes through long continued natural selection. However, this adaptive superiority of inversion heterozygotes breaks down in interracial hybridization experiments when two gene arrangements are derived from different localities'. This concept has received experimental evidence in its favour on the basis of work done in other species of Drosophila, such as D. willistoni, D. paulistorum, D. pavani and D. bipectinata. In all these species, interracial hybridization led to the loss of superiority of inversion heterozygotes. Further, it has been suggested that coadapted polygenic complexes contained in the chromosomes are disrupted as a result of recombination in interstrain crosses. This concept was also tested in D. ananassae, a cosmopolitan and domestic species commonly found in India, while employing three cosmopolitan inversions exhibiting heterotic buffering. In interstrain crosses involving monomorphic and polymorphic strains due to three cosmopolitan inversions, the persistence of heterosis was observed, which does not support the above-mentioned hypothesis of Dobzhansky. Thus, evidence for coadaptation is lacking in natural populations of D. ananassae, which is considered as an exception to the Dobzhansky's concept of genetic coadaptation. Thus, heterotic buffering associated with the three cosmopolitan inversions in D. ananassae is not populational heterosis; rather, it appears to be simple luxuriance.","[Singh, Bashisth N.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Genet Lab, Dept Zool, Inst Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Singh, BN (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Genet Lab, Dept Zool, Inst Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",bashisthsingh2004@rediffmail.com,,,,,,,89,3,3,0,5,INDIAN ACAD SCIENCES,BANGALORE,"C V RAMAN AVENUE, SADASHIVANAGAR, P B #8005, BANGALORE 560 080, INDIA",0022-1333,0973-7731,,J GENET,J.

ICLs are thought to form a link between the same strand (intra-strand) or complimentary strand (inter-strand) and thereby increase the stability of DNA, which forbids the processes like replication and transcription. As a result, cell death occurs. In this work, we have studied the enhanced stability of a double stranded DNA in the presence of ICLs and compared our findings with the results obtained in the absence of these links. Using atomistic simulations with explicit solvent, a force is applied along and perpendicular to the direction of the helix and we measured the rupture force and the unzipping force of DNA-ICL complexes. Our results show that the rupture and the unzipping forces increase significantly in the presence of these links. The ICLs bind to the minor groove of DNA, which enhance the DNA stabilisation. Such information may be used to design alternative drugs that can stall replication and transcription that are critical to a growing number of anticancer drug discovery efforts.

The present study was conducted under near-natural field conditions to evaluate the effects of supplemental (s)-UV-B (ambient+3.6 kJ m(-2) day(-1)) treatment alone, and in combination with two doses of IAA (200 ppm and 400 ppm) exogenously applied as foliar spray on various growth-, morphological-, physiological-, and biochemical parameters of an indigenous medicinal plant, Coleus forskohlii. Under s-UV-B, the plant growth and morphology were adversely affected (along with reductions in protein- and chlorophyll contents) with concomitant increase in secondary metabolites (as substantiated by an increase in the activities of various enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway) and cumulative antioxidative potential (CAP), suggesting the plant's capability of adaptive resilience against UV-B. The essential oil content of the plant was, however, compromised reducing its pharmaceutical value. IAA application at both doses led to a reversal in the effects caused by s-UV-B radiation alone; both the plant growth as well as the essential oil content improved, especially at the higher IAA dose, suggesting its ameliorative role against UV-B induced oxidative stress, and also in improving the plant's medicinal value.","[Takshak, Swabha; Agrawal, Shashi Bhushan] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Bot, Lab Air Pollut & Global Climate Change, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Agrawal, SB (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Bot, Lab Air Pollut & Global Climate Change, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",swabha.1987@gmail.com; sbagrawal56@gmail.com,,,"University Grants Commission (UGC); Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), New Delhi","University Grants Commission (UGC)(University Grants Commission, India); Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), New Delhi(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India)","The authors are thankful to the Head, Department of Botany and Coordinator, Centre of Advanced Study in Botany, and Fund for Improvement of Science and Technology Infrastructure (FIST), Department of Science and Technology, Interdisciplinary School of Life Sciences (DBT), Banaras Hindu University, for providing laboratory facilities, and to the University Grants Commission (UGC), and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), New Delhi, for financial assistance.",,145,14,14,3,29,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-6513,1090-2414,,ECOTOX ENVIRON SAFE,Ecotox.

Kisspeptins (KPs) are a group of neuropeptide hormones that act via G-protein coupled receptor 54 (GPR54) to stimulate hypothalamic secretion of Gonadotropin-releasing hormone, thereby regulating ovarian steroidogenesis, folliculogenesis, and ovulation. GPR54 is also expressed in the ovary, suggesting a direct role for KPs in ovarian steroidogenesis. The aim of present study was to determine if a low serum level of KP is responsible for reduced progesterone and estradiol levels during the period of delayed embryonic development in C. sphinx. Indeed, low serum KP abundance corresponded to reduced expression of GPR54 in ovarian luteal cells during the period of delayed development compared to normal development. In vitro and in vivo treatment with KP increased GPR54 abundance, via Extracellular signal regulated kinase and its downstream mediators, leading to increased progesterone synthesis in the ovary during delayed embryonic development. KP treatment also increased cholesterol uptake and elevated expression of Luteinizing hormone receptor and Steroid acute regulatory protein in the ovary, suggesting that elevation in circulating KP during delayed embryonic development may reactivate luteal activity. KPs may also enhance cell survival (BCL-2, reduced Caspase 3 activity) and angiogenesis (Vascular endothelium growth factor) during this period. The findings of this study thus demonstrate a regulatory role for KPs in the maintenance of luteal steroidogenesis during pregnancy in C. sphinx.","[Anuradha; Krishna, Amitabh] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Krishna, A (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",akrishna_ak@yahoo.co.in,", Anuradha/ABG-1215-2020",", Anuradha/0000-0002-7794-9025","Department of Science and Technology (DST), New Delhi, India [SR/SO/AS-03/2010]","Department of Science and Technology (DST), New Delhi, India(Department of Science & Technology (India))","Department of Science and Technology (DST), New Delhi, India, Grant number: SR/SO/AS-03/2010",,35,6,6,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1040-452X,1098-2795,,MOL REPROD DEV,Mol.

Healing process of wounds, inflicted on head skin, using biopsy punch was observed at intervals0hour (h), 1, 2, 4, 6, 12h, 1day (d) 2 and 4d. Accumulation of mucus in wound region within 1h after infliction of wound has been considered an immediate measure to provide protection to injured skin from microbial invasion and other external environmental hazards. On infliction of wound, mobilization of epithelial cells at wound edge is associated with disturbance of coaptive relationship of epithelial cells till original coaptive stability is reached. At 6-12h appearance of epidermal ridge in region of contact of migrating fronts is due to piling up of epithelial cells. This is associated with cessation of migration of epithelial cells and their simultaneous continual arrival in the region. Speedy epithelialization of skin wounds in C. mrigala like in other fishes, compared to that of mammals and other higher vertebrates, is possibly facilitated owing to surrounding wet external environment. Microridges in initial stages of wound healing appear fragmented without particular orientation. Further, epithelial cells in epithelium in wound region and in region adjacent to wound elongate. These changes are associated with the stretching of epithelial cells indicating their streaming and migration, toward wound. Presence of superficial neuromasts, smallest functional units of lateral line system, a hydrodynamic sensory system, has been associated with important functional significance in fish.","[Verma, Neeraj; Mittal, Swati] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Zool, Skin Physiol Lab,Ctr Adv Study, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Kumari, Usha] Banaras Hindu Univ, Zool Sect, Mahila Mahavidyalaya, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Mittal, Ajay Kumar] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, 9 Mani Nagar, Varanasi 221106, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Mittal, S (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Zool, Skin Physiol Lab,Ctr Adv Study, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",drsmittal73@gmail.com,"Mittal, Ajay/AAE-3475-2019","Mittal, Swati/0000-0001-5255-1056",CAS-JRF; CAS-SRF under scheme CAS-merged R-A/c grant [14740],CAS-JRF; CAS-SRF under scheme CAS-merged R-A/c grant,"CAS-JRF and CAS-SRF under scheme CAS-merged R-A/c grant, Award No. 14740 (Banaras Hindu University)",,51,7,7,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1059-910X,1097-0029,,MICROSC RES TECHNIQ,Microsc.

The synthesis of the nanoparticles of size 10-15 nm were carried out via co-precipitation method followed by heat treatment at different temperatures. Structural studies confirm the formation of polycrystalline Fd 3m phase of Fe3O4 when the samples were sintered up to 600 degrees C. FTIR studies show that PVA and magnetic grains were attached through hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl group of PVA and protonated surface of the oxide. Spin glass type transition was observed in the ZFC-FC plots at 125 K which is also the Verwey transition temperature T-V as measured from the transport studies. A hysteresis in the MR plot was found which was explained in the realm of tunnel transport through ferromagnetic grain and anti-ferromagnetic surface of the ferrite particles. Tunnelling through the dielectric spacer layer of PVA has an overall impact to increase the resistance of the samples. The temperature dependence of the hysteresis gives a major hint to the origin of the spin glass type behaviour of the samples.","[Ghosh, Surajit; Patel, Prayas Chandra; Srivastava, P.

In the past three decades, there has been an increase in incidence and non-responsiveness to conventional antifungals, which suggests that there is a need of antifungal sensitivity testing. Aims: This study was aimed at identifying clinico-mycological pattern of dermatophytic infections in patients attending thedermatology outpatient department of a tertiary care hospital, and to obtain the sensitivity pattern of isolates against six commonly used oral antifungals (fluconazole, terbinafine, itraconazole, ketoconazole, griseofulvin and voriconazole). Methods: Patients with suspected dermatophytoses attending the outpatient department of Sir Sunderlal Hospital, Varanasi, were enrolled in the study. A detailed history, clinical examination and sample collection for mycological examinations was done. In vitro antifungal sensitivity testing was done on species isolated from culture as per the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute M38-A standards, with broth microdilution method. Results: There were 256 patients recruited in the study, with a male: female ratio of 3: 1. The most commonly affected age group was 20-40 years (52.4%). Tinea corporis et cruris was the most common type observed (27.2%). Potassium hydroxide positivity was seen in 211 samples (79.6%) and culture positivity was found in 139 samples (52.4%). The most common species identified was Trichophyton mentagrophytes (75.9%). Sensitivity testing was done on fifty isolates of T. mentagrophytes. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of itraconazole, ketoconazole, terbinafine and voriconazole were comparable, while griseofulvin showed the highest minimum inhibitory concentration. Itraconazole was found to be the most effective drug, followed by ketoconazole, terbinafine and fluconazole. Griseofulvin was the least effective drug among the tested antifungals. Limitations: This is a hospital-based study, and may not reflect the true pattern in the community. Sensitivity pattern of only one species T. mentagrophytes was carried out. Conclusion: Inadequate and irregular use of antifungal drugs has led to the emergence of resistant strains, which cause poor treatment outcomes. Thus, it is very important to test for antifungal sensitivity to check for resistance to antifungals.","[Mahajan, Soniya; Pandey, Shyam S.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Dermatol & Venereol, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Tilak, Ragini; Kaushal, Satyendra K.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Microbiol, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Mishra, Rabindra N.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Community Med, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Mahajan, S (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Room 43 Lady Doctors Hostel, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",soniya.mahajan@yahoo.com,,,Microbiology Departmental,Microbiology Departmental,Microbiology Departmental for financing microtitre plates and RPMI-1640 solution to conduct tests.,,48,32,32,0,2,WOLTERS KLUWER MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS,MUMBAI,"WOLTERS KLUWER INDIA PVT LTD , A-202, 2ND FLR, QUBE, C T S  NO 1498A-2 VILLAGE MAROL, ANDHERI EAST, MUMBAI, 400059, INDIA",0378-6323,0973-3922,,INDIAN J DERMATOL VE,Indian J.

The equinox maximum in EPB occurrences for high solar activity years could be caused by the vertical F-layer drift due to pre-reversal electric field (PRE), and expected to be maximum when daynight terminator aligns with the magnetic meridian i.e. during the equinox months whereas maximum occurrences during the solstice months of solar minimum could be caused by the seed perturbation in plasma density induced by gravity waves from tropospheric origins. Generally EPB occurrences are found to be more prominent during nighttime hours (2000-2400 hours) than the daytime hours. Peak in EPB occurrences is in early night for high solar activity years whereas same is late night for low solar activity. The day and nighttime EPB occurrences have been analyzed and found to vary in accordance with solar activity with an annual correlation coefficient (R) of similar to 0.99 with F-10.7 cm solar Flux. Additionally, solar activity influence on EPB occur-rences is seasonal dependent with a maximum influence during the equinox season (R = 0.88) and a minimum during winter season (R = 0.73). The solar activity influences on EPB occurrences are found in agreement with the previous works reported in the Brazilian, African-Asian and Pacific longitudes sector but different than that in Atlantic sector.","[Kumar, Sanjay] Banaras Hindu Univ, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Kumar, S (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",sanjay.skitvns@gmail.com,,,SERB New Delhi [SR/FTP/ES-164/2014],"SERB New Delhi(Department of Science & Technology (India)Science Engineering Research Board (SERB), India)",The work is financially supported by SERB New Delhi (SR/FTP/ES-164/2014).

The density functional formalism of classical statistical mechanics is used to find an exact expression for the difference in the grand thermodynamic potentials of the two coexisting phases. The expression involves both the symmetry conserving and the symmetry broken parts of the direct pair correlation function. The theory is used to calculate phase diagram of systems of soft spheres interacting via inverse power potentials u(r) = epsilon (sigma/r)(n),where parameter n measures softness of the potential. We find that for 1/n < 0.154 systems freeze into the face centered cubic (fcc) structure while for 1/n >= 0.154 the body-centred-cubic (bcc) structure is preferred. The bcc structure transforms into the fcc structure upon increasing the density.

Some members of this gene family are involved in negative regulation of powdery mildew resistance, while others are involved in several other biological functions. Mlo proteins have characteristic seven transmembrane domains and a calmodulin-binding domain at their C-termini, and are associated with plasma membrane. The Mlo gene family has been studied in several economically important cereals, but little information is available on this gene family in the important legumes, Medicago truncatula Gaertn. and Cicer arietinum L. We carried out a comprehensive and comparative investigation of the Mlo gene family in these two species using the genome sequences available at the M. truncatula genome database (Mt v4.0) and NCBI (C. arietinum). A genome-wide homology-based search using Arabidopsis Mlo proteins as query identified 16 MtMlo (M. truncatula Mlo) and 14 CarMlo (C. arietinum Mlo) genes. The MtMlo and CarMlo genes had comparable gene structure, protein sequence and topology. Their chromosomal locations indicated the occurrence of extensive reorganization in the genomes of the two species after their divergence from the common ancestor. A multiple sequence alignment of 53 Mlo proteins from these two and several other species showed a highly conserved sequence block of seven amino acids, viz., L-ETPTW, towards their N-termini. The evolutionary phylogenetic analysis grouped the MtMlo and CarMlo members into four clusters, and most of the MtMlo and CarMlo members formed one-to-one ortholog pairs. The ka/ks analyses indicated that the MtMlo and CarMlo genes are subjected to intense purifying selection.","[Deshmukh, Reena; Singh, V.

The impact of this recent extreme low solar activity period on ionosphere is investigated. It is observed that the scintillation occurrence is low having maximum percentage occurrence during pre-midnight periods. With increasing interest in understanding the behavior of ionospheric irregularities, an effort has been made to examine also the influence of solar and magnetic activity over the occurrence of scintillations. During the extreme low solar activity years the scintillation occurrences do not vary linearly with the sunspot number. The inhibition and generation of irregularities during enhanced magnetic activity period are explained by considering changes in the electric field. The spectral analysis provide spectral index for irregularities which varied between -1.5 and -8 and characteristic length of irregularities varied between 400 and 1200 m which confirms that 250 MHz scintillations observed over Varanasi were associated with intermediate scale irregularities.","[Singh, S.

Structure of EMTAHDCA clearly indicated that it is a novel compound that was not reported in literature or natural product database. The compound exhibited growth inhibiting effects mainly against the gram negative bacterial strains and produced maximum zone of inhibition at 150 mu g/mL concentration. The compound was evaluated through in silico studies for its ability to bind 30S ribosomal fragment (PDB ID: 1YRJ, 1MWL, 1J7T, and 1LC4) and OmpF porin protein (4GCP, 4GCQ, and 4GCS) which are the common targets of various antibiotic drugs. Comparative molecular docking study revealed that EMTAHDCA has strong binding affinity for these selected targets in comparison to a number of most commonly used antibiotics. The ability of EMTAHDCA to bind the active sites on the proteins and 30S ribosomal fragments where the antibiotic drugs generally bind indicated that it is functionally similar to the commercially available drugs.","[Niveshika; Verma, Ekta; Mishra, Arun k.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Bot, Lab Microbial Genet, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Singh, Angad K.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Chem, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Singh, Vinay K.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Sch Biotechnol, Ctr Bioinformat, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Mishra, AK (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Bot, Lab Microbial Genet, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India.",akmishraau@rediffmail.com,"SINGH, ANGAD KUMAR/AAV-4127-2021; S, Niveshika/EQP-4156-2022","S, Niveshika/0000-0003-1162-9333; Verma, Ekta/0000-0002-1601-949X","UGC, New Delhi","UGC, New Delhi(University Grants Commission, India)","The Head and coordinator CAS, Department of Botany, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India is gratefully acknowledged for providing laboratory facilities.

One-third of RCC patients develops skeletal metastasis with a poor 5-year survival rate. Data explaining how some of these tumors show sooner bony metastasis than expected is sparse. The objective of this study was to identify whether tumor size can act as a predictor of bony metastases among patients of RCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scan and clinical records of 66 patients with RCC, who fulfilled specified inclusion criteria. Patients who had bony metastasis at the time of presentation were selected as case and those without skeletal metastasis were referred to as controls. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the appropriate cut-off value for tumor size, which was measured as the longest tumor diameter (LTD) in one-dimensional (1D). RESULTS: Of the 66 patients selected, 30% developed bone metastasis. The tumor size of RCCs significantly correlated with the presence of skeletal metastasis in our study. None of the patients with 1D LTD < 4.8 cm on CECT were found to have skeletal metastasis. ROC analysis revealed that the accuracy of the LTD in predicting bone metastasis was high with an area under ROC curve of 0.823. A cut-off value of 7.5 cm had a sensitivity of 78.9% and specificity of 80.9%. CONCLUSION: The 1D LTD with a cut-off value of 7.5 cm, at the time of presentation is an important predictor of skeletal metastasis. The result of this study may have role in triage of patients into a subgroup which mandates more aggressive treatment and monitoring.","[Dwivedi, A. N. D.; Srinivasan, A.; Shukla, R.

On irradiation, surface topography (from atomic force microscopy) has revealed the columnar arrangement of grains with increased value of rms surface roughness which in turn also affects the magnetic behaviour. Magnetization measurements have shown the enhancement in saturation magnetization and coercivity value with increased magnetic signal strength after irradiation. Current-voltage measurement across the irradiated CoFe/n-Si interface has shown the enhancement in current data by two orders of magnitude as compared to unirradiated interface.

The structures of H2L1 and 1 have been authenticated by single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. Complexes 1 and 2 strongly fluoresce and act as highly selective and sensitive chemosensors for picric acid in different organic as well as aqueous media. Both 1 and 2 showed strong potential to detect traces of PA in vapour/solid phase through contact mode analysis. Spectral and theoretical (DFT) studies suggested that the observed fluorescence quenching may be associated with ground state (GS) charge transfer as well as electrostatic interactions between 1/2 and PA. The fluorescence lifetime for the representative complex 1 displayed a double exponential curve and unaltered lifetime (tau(av), 0.63 nm) in the absence and presence of PA and strongly suggested that quenching follows a static mechanism. Further, DFT calculations on 1 and 2 strongly supported the static mechanism through GS charge transfer between complexes and PA. In addition, H-1 NMR spectral studies on 1-2 in the presence of PA firmly advocated strong hydrogen bonding and pi-pi stacking between the phenolic rings of 1-2 and the aromatic ring of PA. These complexes are capable of detecting PA either individually or in a competitive environment of other nitro-explosives. Florescence spectral studies on the model complex M lacking N, N-diethylamine groups revealed moderate selectivity and sensitivity towards PA and supported the key role of N, N-diethylamine moieties in the selectivity and sensitivity of complexes.","[Kumar, Amit; Kumar, Ashish; Pandey, Daya Shankar] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Chem, Inst Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Pandey, DS (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Chem, Inst Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",dspbhu@bhu.ac.in,"Kumar, Ashish/GRR-3470-2022; Kumar, Ashish/GRJ-3967-2022; Kumar, Amit/H-7327-2014","Kumar, Ashish/0000-0002-4476-3494; Kumar, Amit/0000-0002-8453-5621","Department of Science and Technology (DST) New Delhi, India [SR/S1/IC-25/2011]; Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), New Delhi, India for award of JRF/SRF [09/013(0330)/2009-EMR-I]","Department of Science and Technology (DST) New Delhi, India(Department of Science & Technology (India)); Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), New Delhi, India for award of JRF/SRF","DSP thanks the Department of Science and Technology (DST) New Delhi, India for providing financial assistance through scheme SR/S1/IC-25/2011 and AK acknowledges the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), New Delhi, India for award of JRF/SRF (09/013(0330)/2009-EMR-I).

Keeping this in view, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the mechanistic role of diets during stress response at cellular and metabolic level in D. ananassae. To gain insight into the molecular and physiological basis of variation in stress tolerance in flies developed on different nutritional regimes, we identified a novel factor that depositions of uric acid crystals in Malpighian tubules of flies has a regulatory role in tolerance to desiccation. To assess the role of diet in variation in the physiological process by immunostaining method, we checked (Na+/K+) ion-pump in Malpighian tubules. Results suggest that physiological activities of flies fed on carbohydrate food are higher as indicated by the elevated level of (Na+/K+)-ATPase ion transport. We also found significant dietary effects on egg production and egg-to-adult viability, suggesting a possible trade-off between the traits investigated. Expression of Hsp60 was also modulated by diet. Hsp60 was highly expressed in carbohydrate and protein-enriched medium compared to normal food.","[Sisodia, Seema; Singh, Bashisth Narayan] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Genet Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Verma, Puja] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Cytogenet Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Singh, BN (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Genet Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",bashisthsingh2004@rediffmail.com,,,"Department of Science and Technology, New Delhi","Department of Science and Technology, New Delhi(Department of Science & Technology (India))","S.S. thanks the Department of Science and Technology, New Delhi for providing financial assistance in the form of Women Scientist Scheme.

These interacting theories are generalized onto a (4, 2)-dimensional supermanifold that is parametrized by the four (3 + 1)-dimensional (4D) spacetime variables and a pair of Grassmannian variables. To derive the (anti-)BRST symmetries for the matter fields, we impose the gauge-invariant restrictions (GIRs) on the superfields defined on the (4, 2)-dimensional supermanifold. We discuss various outcomes that emerge out from our knowledge of the SUSP unitary operator and its Hermitian conjugate.

The approximate solution of the eigenvalue problem is obtained by using the Galerkin's method, when the gap between the cylinders is narrow. The numerical values of the critical wave number and the critical Taylor number are computed from the obtained approximate expression. It is found that the numerical values of the critical wave number and the critical Taylor number obtained by taking three terms in the Galerkin method agree very well with earlier results obtained by the shooting method. The amplitude of the radial velocity and the cell-pattern are also shown on the graphs for different values of the ratio of the angular velocities. The effects of ratios of angular velocities, radial temperature gradient and magnetic field on the stability of flows are discussed. It is found that the effect of the magnetic field is to inhibit the onset of instability but the effect of heat flux on the outer cylinder is to increase the onset of instability. These effects are more when the cylinders are rotating in anti clockwise sense.","[Prasad, Rajendra; Singh, A.

XRD data have shown the presence of CoFe (bcc phase) and beta-FeSi2 phases for CoFe/p-Si interfacial structures, whereas CoFe/n-Si interfacial structures have shown the presence of CoFe (bcc and fcc) phases along with Fe3Si, epsilon-FeSi and beta-FeSi2 silicide phases having nanodimension crystallites. The M-H characteristics have shown the superparamagnetic type behaviour for CoFe/p-Si structure, whereas CoFe/n-Si structure shows a feature of interfacial antiferromagnetic (AF) coupling. The observed magnetic behaviour has been understood due to the presence of various magnetic phases and their nanosized grains. The MFM data of domain size have also been correlated with the observed magnetic behaviour. CoFe/n-Si structures have shown a significant feature of giant magnetoresistance (GMR) as compared to CoFe/p-Si structures.

GC-MS analysis of EO identified cymene as chief component (76.27%) followed by thymol (13.30%), DL-limonene (3.23%), 1,8-cineole (2.58%) and gamma-terpinene (1.68%). The minimum inhibitory (MIC) and minimum aflatoxin inhibitory concentrations (MAIC) of EO were 0.8 and 0.6 mu L/mL, respectively, against Aspergillus flavus LHP(C)-D6. Among EO components, thymol showed the highest antifungal and antiaflatoxigenic activity suggesting synergistic mode of action of EO components. Microscopic observations at sub lethal and lethal concentrations of EO using SEM and TEM revealed its mode of action on fungal plasma membrane causing considerable reduction in ergosterol quantity and increased leakages of Ca+2, K+ and Mg+2 from EO treated A. flavus cells. The EO completely inhibited aflatoxin B-1 production in wheat and chickpea as analyzed through HPLC and caused no toxicity in seed viability. The LD50 of EO was 6620.43 mu/kg for oral-toxicity on mice and IC50 was 0.467 mu L/mL through DPPH analysis. The ajowan EO may thus be formulated as safe plant based preservative for enhancement of shelf life of food items. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To predict the vegetation response to future global change, experimental validations from other regions are widely needed. We assessed the effects of N treatment by urea fertilization on the diversity and biomass of the herbaceous plant traits (HPTs) in a dry tropical environment of India. Methods Diversity and biomass of different HPTs were determined on the basis of data collected in year 2010, from 135, 1 m x 1 m plots distributed over 15 locations. The plots were treated with urea fertilizer in different doses (Control, 60 kgNha(-1) yr(-1) and 120 kg N ha(-1)yr(-1)) since 1st January 2007. The plots were ordinated and data were subjected to appropriate statistical analyses. Important Findings Correspondence analysis (CA) suggested uniqueness of species composition due to N amendment. Species number and biomass of the trait categories varied due to N fertilization and traits. All studied trait categories (except N-fixers) yielded maximum mean species number at moderate level of N fertilization. Different levels of N fertilization exhibited different species diversity-primary productivity (D-P) relationships. Further, study showed reduction in plant diversity due to increase in biomass at high rates of N addition. Conclusions Tall, erect, non N-fixers, annuals, grasses HPTs were favoured by N enrichment. N dose above 60 kg enhanced the biomass of fast growing, erect, annuals, non N-fixers, nitrophilic HPTs. The changes in traits with N addition, especially the increase in annuals and grasses and decrease in typically N-rich N-fixers, have implications for sustainable cattle production.","[Verma, Punita; Sagar, R.; Verma, Hariom; Verma, Preeti; Singh, Dharmendra K.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Bot, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Sagar, R (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Bot, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",sagar@bhu.ac.in,,"Sagar, R/0000-0001-5140-2737","Department of Science and Technology, New Delhi","Department of Science and Technology, New Delhi(Department of Science & Technology (India))","The authors are thankful to Department of Science and Technology, New Delhi for providing the financial support.

Results: Sirtuin inhibitors induced apoptosis-like changes in blood platelets, associated with a rise in active Bax and a significant drop in platelet count. Conclusion: Sirtuins act as a central player in the determination of platelet aging. Significance: This study refocuses attention on the potential side effect of sirtuin inhibition in delimiting platelet life span and management of thrombosis. Sirtuins are evolutionarily conserved NAD(+)-dependent acetyl-lysine deacetylases that belong to class III type histone deacetylases. In humans, seven sirtuin isoforms (Sirt1 to Sirt7) have been identified. Sirtinol, a cell-permeable lactone ring derived from naphthol, is a dual Sirt1/Sirt2 inhibitor of low potency, whereas EX-527 is a potent and selective Sirt1 inhibitor. Here we demonstrate that Sirt1, Sirt2, and Sirt3 are expressed in enucleate platelets. Both sirtinol and EX-527 induced apoptosis-like changes in platelets, as revealed by enhanced annexin V binding, reactive oxygen species production, and drop in mitochondrial transmembrane potential. These changes were associated with increased phagocytic clearance of the platelets by macrophages. Expression of acetylated p53 and the conformationally active form of Bax were found to be significantly higher in both sirtinol- and EX-527-treated platelets, implicating the p53-Bax axis in apoptosis induced by sirtuin inhibitors. Administration of either sirtinol or EX-527 in mice led to a reduction in both platelet count and the number of reticulated platelets. Our results, for the first time, implicate sirtuins as a central player in the determination of platelet aging. Because sirtuin inhibitors are being evaluated for their antitumor activity, this study refocuses attention on the potential side effect of sirtuin inhibition in delimiting platelet life span and management of thrombosis.","[Kumari, Sharda; Chaurasia, Susheel N.; Nayak, Manasa K.; Mallick, Ram L.; Dash, Debabrata] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Biochem, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Dash, D (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Biochem, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",ddash.biochem@gmail.com,"kumari, sharda/AAO-5300-2020; DASH, DEBABRATA/AAF-1837-2020; Nayak, Manasa/AAZ-9439-2021","kumari, sharda/0000-0001-5864-5475; Nayak, Manasa/0000-0001-6461-0543","Department of Biotechnology, Government of India; Department of Science and Technology, Government of India; DST-FIST Program; Indian Council of Medical Research; Council of Scientific and Industrial Research; Tata innovation fellowship grant from DBT","Department of Biotechnology, Government of India(Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India); Department of Science and Technology, Government of India(Department of Science & Technology (India)); DST-FIST Program(Department of Science & Technology (India)); Indian Council of Medical Research(Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)); Council of Scientific and Industrial Research(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India); Tata innovation fellowship grant from DBT","This work was supported by grants from the Department of Biotechnology and the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India; the DST-FIST Program; the Indian Council of Medical Research; and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, and a Tata innovation fellowship grant from the DBT (to D.

Nostoc sp. strain HKAR-2, a thermophilic cyanobacterium, was isolated from the hot-spring, Rajgir, whereas, Nostoc sp. HKAR-6 was a rice-field isolate from Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi. Complete killing of the cells occurred after 48 h of UV-B exposure in Nostoc sp. strain HKAR-6, whereas in case of Nostoc sp. strain HKAR-2 death occurred only after 72 h. Chlorophyll a and phycocyanin content were found to be adversely affected by UV-B irradiation in both the test organisms. However, a progressive increase in carotenoids content was observed upto 10 h of UV-B exposure but subsequently declined after 12 h in both the Nostoc sp. The antioxidative enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase and peroxidase that scavenge the UV-B generated harmful reactive oxygen species were found to have multifold induction in their content in both the strains following UV-B exposure in comparison to non-irradiated control cultures. In addition, these organisms also synthesize mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs); able to carry out UV-screening. Porphyra-334 and shinorine were found to be the common MAAs in both the Nostoc sp., while an unknown MAAs with a retention time of 6.9 min (lambda(max)-334 nm) was found in Nostoc sp. strain HKAR-2. Findings from this study suggest that both enzymatic and non-enzymatic defense mechanisms are being employed by Nostoc sp. strain HKAR-2 and Nostoc sp. strain HKAR-6 to counteract the damaging effects of UV-B radiation.","[Richa; Sinha, Rajeshwar P.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Adv Study Bot, Lab Photobiol & Mol Microbiol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Sinha, RP (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Adv Study Bot, Lab Photobiol & Mol Microbiol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",r.p.sinha@gmx.net,"Sinha, Rajeshwar/CAC-2606-2022","Sinha, Rajeshwar/0000-0002-0112-6161","Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India [SR/WOS-A/LS-140/2011]","Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India(Department of Science & Technology (India))","Richa is thankful to Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India, for the financial assistance in the form of a fellowship under the project (no.

However, the expression of these proteins during aging has not been analyzed. In the present study, we have examined the age-related changes in the expression of these proteins in cerebral cortex and hippocampus of 10-, 30-, 50-, and 80-week-old male mice. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis indicated that messenger RNA (mRNA) level of Nrxn1 and Nlgn3 significantly increased from 10 to 30 weeks and then decreased at 50 weeks in both the regions. However, in 80-week-old mice, Nrxn1 and Nlgn3 were further downregulated in cerebral cortex while Nrxn1 was downregulated and Nlgn3 was upregulated in hippocampus. These findings were corroborated by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence results. When the expression of Nrxn1 and Nlgn3 was correlated with presynaptic density marker synaptophysin, it was found that synaptophysin protein expression in cerebral cortex was high at 10 weeks and decreased gradually up to 80 weeks, whereas in hippocampus, it decreased until 50 weeks and then increased remarkably at 80 weeks. Furthermore, Pearson's correlation analysis showed that synaptophysin had a strong relation with Nrxn1 and Nlgn3 in cerebral cortex and with Nlgn3 in hippocampus. Thus, these findings showed that Nrxn1 and Nlgn3 are differentially expressed in cerebral cortex and hippocampus which might be responsible for alterations in synaptic plasticity during aging.","[Kumar, Dhiraj; Thakur, M.

Consequently, the present study was aimed to design epitope-based vaccine against Listeria. LLO, ILO, and SLO proteins from L. monocytogenes, L. ivanovii and L. seeligeri, respectively were analyzed using various bioinformatics and immuonoinformatics tools, including sequence and structure-based ones. A total of 11 antigenic B-cell epitopes, and 4 and 3 allelic classes for MHC class I and MHC class II binding peptides, respectively were predicted for LLO protein. The unique peptide (363)LGDLRD(368) was identified in the LLO protein. Further, we also observed that IgG class of B-cells were predominant in these proteins. The study revealed potential B-cell and T-cell epitope that can raise the desired immune response against these proteins.

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) mediated signaling plays a key role in malignant transformation. Cell proliferation and cell survival of tumor cell are induced by hyper activation of PI3K, AKT1, glycolytic enzyme LDH-A, and inactivation of tumor suppressor gene p53. Dietary flavonoids such as quercetin are considered a powerful modulator of different cellular signaling pathways. The present study is focused on the role of quercetin on regulation of PI3K/AKT pathways in Dalton's lymphoma mice. Effect of quercetin was analyzed in ascite cells in terms of cell viability, glycolytic metabolism as well as expression, and level of PI3K (regulatory and catalytic subunit), AKT1, and p53 using standard methods. Results reflect hyperactivation of PI3K signaling in ascite cells of Dalton's lymphoma mice, leading to activation of AKT1 and inactivation of p53. Quercetin modulates the pathway toward suppression of lymphoma. Glycolytic metabolism was also downregulated by quercetin. Its tumor suppressor activity was confirmed by morphological parameters and longevity of mice. The findings suggest that quercetin may contribute to lymphoma prevention by downregulating PI3K-AKT1-p53 pathway as well as by glycolytic metabolism.","[Maurya, Akhilendra Kumar; Vinayak, Manjula] Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Adv Study Zool, Biochem & Mol Biol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Vinayak, M (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Adv Study Zool, Biochem & Mol Biol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",manjulavinayak@rediffmail.com,,"Maurya, Akhilendra Kumar/0000-0001-5107-9546","University Grants Commission, India; Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), India (CSIR) [09/013(0338)/2010-EMR-I]","University Grants Commission, India(University Grants Commission, India); Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), India (CSIR)","The research was supported by University Grants Commission, India.

The article specifically looks at investigational drugs, which have demonstrated, at the very least, in vitro and in vivo activities against the leishmania species that cause visceral leishmaniasis. Specifically, the authors review the nitroimidazole compound fexinidazole, which is one of the few drugs which have reached Phase II trials. The article also discusses the R enantiomer of (S)-PA-824, which has shown good antileishmanial activity. Finally, the article also highlights the many novel delivery systems and oral formulations of amphotericin B, which are both cheap and less toxic and are currently under investigation.

Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate the expression dynamics of MT1R in testis and its interaction with testicular steroidogenesis in a long-day breeder, Mesocricetus auratus. Hamsters were exposed to different photoperiodic conditions i.e. critical- (CP; 12.5L:11.5D); short-day- (SD; 8L:16D) and long-day- (LD; 16L:8D) for 10 weeks wherein testicular steroidogenesis, local melatonin synthesis and the expression of MT1R were analyzed. SD induced melatonin suppressed testicular steroidogenesis as evident from regressed testicular histoarchitecture, decreased expression of AR, StAR, LH-R, P450SCC and enzyme activities of 3 beta- and 17 beta-HSD. Differential photoperiodic regulation of MT1R expression in testis suggests its involvement in photoperiodic signal transduction for seasonal adjustment of reproduction. Increased S-NAT (Serotonin N-acetyl transferase) activity and local testicular melatonin under SD condition suggest an inhibitory effect of the local melatonergic system on testicular steroidogenesis. Completely opposite responses were recorded for all the parameters analyzed when hamsters were exposed to CP or LD conditions.

However, molecular mechanism underlying lung toxicity caused by PQ has not been elucidated. Curcumin, a known anti-inflammatory molecule derived from rhizomes of Curcuma Ion go has variety of pharmacological activities including free-radical scavenging properties but the protective effects of curcumin oh PQ-induced acute lung injury (ALI) have not been studied. In this study, we aimed to study the effects of curcumin on ALI caused by PQ in male parke's strain mice which were challenged acutely by PQ (50 mg/kg, i.p.) with or without curcumin an hour before (5 mg/kg, i.n.) PQ intoxication. Lung specimens and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were isolated for pathological and biochemical analysis after 48 h of PQ exposure. Curcumin administration has significantly enhanced superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities. Lung wet/dry weight ratio, malondialdehyde (MDA) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) content, total cell number and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels in BALF as well as neutrophil infiltration were attenuated by curcumin. Pathological studies also revealed that intranasal curcumin alleviate PQ-induced pulmonary damage and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and nitric oxide (NO). These results suggest that intranasal curcumin may directly target lungs and curcumin inhalers may prove to be effective in PQ-induced ALI treatment in near future. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Chronic hypoxaemia may also lead to polycythaemia in the fetal and neonatal period. Aim: To evaluate venous haematocrit and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) in term IUGR neonates in the immediate postnatal period. Methods: This was a prospective observational study of 54 clinically healthy term IUGR neonates as cases and 50 term, appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA), healthy neonates as controls. IUGR was defined as birthweight <10th per centile for gestational age. Neonates with perinatal asphyxia, sepsis and other systemic diseases were excluded. Resistance index (RI), pulsatility index (PI), peak systolic velocity (PSV) and vascular diameter were measured in the internal carotid, vertebral and middle cerebral arteries by transcranial colour Doppler ultrasound between 48 and 72 hours of life, along with the estimation of venous haematocrit. Neonates were observed for development of any complications until discharge and followed up clinically and radiologically for a minimum 6 months. Results: Significantly higher resistance (RI and PI) and lower PSV was recorded in all the cerebral arteries of the IUGR than the AGA group whereas no difference was observed in vascular diameters. Mean haematocrit was significantly higher in the IUGR than in the AGA group [55.7 (4.22) vs 45.1 (2.79) g/dl]. Haematocrit was positively correlated with RI and PI, and negatively correlated with PSV. After discharge, three infants in the IUGR group showed hypertonia and delayed developmental milestones along with hypoxic changes in MRI of the brain. Conclusions: Compared with their AGA counterparts, higher venous haematocrit and lower CBFV were observed in clinically healthy, term IUGR neonates during the early neonatal period. Delayed developmental milestones and hypoxic changes were detected by MRI in three infants. Since the study was limited by its sample size, larger studies are required to document the clinical significance of decreased CBFV and its usefulness as a marker of poor prognosis for future neurodevelopment.","[Basu, Sriparna; Dewangan, Shashikant; Barman, Sandeep; Kumar, Ashok] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Paediat, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Shukla, Ram Chandra] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Radiol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Basu, S (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Paediat, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",drsriparnabasu@rediffmail.com,"Kumar, Ashok/AAX-3875-2020; Basu, Sriparna/ABE-8734-2020","Kumar, Ashok/0000-0003-2054-8463; Basu, Sriparna/0000-0001-5048-4849",,,,,25,6,6,0,7,MANEY PUBLISHING,LEEDS,"STE 1C, JOSEPHS WELL, HANOVER WALK, LEEDS LS3 1AB, W YORKS, ENGLAND",2046-9047,2046-9055,,PAEDIATR INT CHILD H,Paediatr.

OsAPX is a 250 amino acid long protein with 90 % sequence similarity to soybean-APX. The 3D model of OsAPX obtained by homology modeling using soybean APX (PDBID:1OAF) as template was associated with -15975.85 kJ/mol energy, 100 % residues in favoured region, verify score of 0.85, ERRAT score 89.625 and a negative ProSA graph, suggesting OsAPX model to be of good quality, robust and reliable which was submitted with Protein Model Database with PMDBID:PM0078091. The rice ascorbate peroxidase ascorbate [OsAPX-Asc] complex had a substrate binding cavity involving residues at position (30)KSCAPL(35), (RCH169)-R-167 and R-172 wherein ascorbate accommodated via three H-bonds involving (30)Lys at the gamma-edge of heme. (169)His served as a bridge between heme-porphyrin of OsAPX and ascorbate creating a charge relay system. Cd bound in [OsAPX-Asc-Cd] complex at (29)EKSCAPL(35), a site similar to ascorbate binding site. The binding of Cd caused breaking of (169)His bridge shifting the protein conformation. Cadmium exhibited four electrostatic interactions via (29)Glu of OsAPX backbone. Docking of [OsAPX-Asc] with jasmonic acid (JA) resulted in [OsAPX-Asc-JA] complex where 4-H-bonds held JA to OsAPX in a cavity at gamma-edge on the distal side of heme. The binding of [OsAPX-Asc-JA] to Cd show the metal to bind at a position other than that involved in binding of OsAPX with Cd alone. Results indicate that Cd does not replace iron or ascorbate or JA but binds to OsAPX on the surface at a separate site electrostatically. In presence of JA the interactions involved in formation of [OsAPXAsc] are restored which is otherwise altered by the presence of Cd. The formation and reformation of H-bond take place between the [OsAPX-Asc] and Cd/JA. It is the interaction between heme and ascorbate which is modulated differently in presence of Cd/JA. In absence of JA, Cd-binds to the [OsAPX-Asc] complex at the proximal end of APX near Asc-binding site, whereas in presence of JA, Cd-binds on the opposite site of the Asc-binding site involving (30)Lys and (29)Glu residues. In-silico binding studies well correlate with the wet-lab results where exogenous application of JA increased the activity of OsAPX in rice grown under Cd-stress. Therefore it is concluded that the activity of OsAPX in rice roots and shoots are compromised under Cd-stress alone.","[Singh, Indra] Banaras Hindu Univ, Mahila Mahavidyalaya, Bioinformat Div, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Shah, Kavita] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Shah, K (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",kavitashah@bhu.ac.in,,"Singh, Indra/0000-0002-9480-4012; SHAH, KAVITA/0000-0003-0464-6100","DST, Govt. of India","DST, Govt. of India(Department of Science & Technology (India))","Authors are grateful to Banaras Hindu University for providing infrastructural facilities for computational studies.

The morphology of the Heusler alloy film surface has also been characterized by atomic force microscopy and magnetic force microscopy (MFM). X-ray diffraction data revealed formation of the CFA alloy phase with the L2(1) structure. MFM results revealed formation of a fine domain structure of average size similar to 10 nm and magnetic signal strength 0.23A degrees. The I-V characteristics are strongly temperature-dependent between similar to 80 K and 300 K for forward bias, compared with weak temperature dependence on reversing the polarity. At low temperature the I-V characteristics have the features of a backward diode. The observed strong temperature dependence is because of thermionic emission of carriers across the interface. The weak temperature dependence is because of dominant field-emission tunnelling of carriers across the interface. Large magnetic field sensitivity of the reverse current has also been observed. The observed magnetic field sensitivity for the reverse current shows the involvement of electronic spin in transport across the interface, from the Heusler alloy to the silicon. An MR of similar to 35% in the presence of a magnetic field was estimated from the I-V data. The study has shown that spin-dependent tunnel transport from the CFA alloy to silicon across the interface results in the observed value of MR, which seems to be because of spin scattering.","[Kumar, Arvind; Srivastava, P.

The structures of metal complexes are elucidated on the basis of elemental analyses, molar conductance, magnetic susceptibility measurements, electronic, ESR, IR and NMR (H-1 and C-13) spectral studies. Both ligands show monobasic tetra-dentate behaviour, bonding through, C=0, two C=N- and a phenolate group. The electronic spectral studies in solid state indicate a square planar geometry for Ni(II) and Cu(II) complexes and a tetrahedral geometry for Co(II) complexes. However, Co(II) and Cu(II) complexes adopt octahedral geometry in DMSO solution. The ESR spectra of Cu(11) complexes in DMSO solution at 77 K predict an elongated tetragonal distorted octahedral geometry around metal ion and presence of unpaired electron in d(x)(-y)(2)(2) orbital. Further, the structures of ligands and their Ni(11) complexes have been satisfactorily modelled by calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). The electronic spectra of Ni(II) complexes are also analyzed in depth with the help of time dependent-DFT (TD-DFT). The theoretical analyses of electronic structure and molecular orbitals have demonstrated that the high-energy absorption bands are M -> L charge transfer and low energy transitions are d-d transitions.

Alterations in its expression during development and aging and the underlying mechanisms are not well studied. Here, we report that NF-kappa B interaction was highest in both cerebral and cerebellar cortices at day 15 when compared with that at day 0 during development, and it further declined significantly in day 45, and remained unchanged in 20 and 70 weeks mice. On the other hand, N-myc interaction was highest at 0 day which significantly declined at 15-day and interestingly remained unaltered at later ages in both the cortices. This age dependent reciprocal pattern of NF-kappa B and N-myc interactions with their cognate GLT-1 promoter sequences was further correlated with GLT-1 protein and transcript levels. We found that higher NF-kappa B interaction with its cognate GLT-1 promoter sequences correlates with up-regulation whereas the higher N-myc interaction correlates with down-regulation of GLT-1 expression during postnatal developmental age up to 15 day, however, such phenomenon was not found in the higher ages from day 45 to 70 weeks. Thus our data suggests a postnatal development- and age dependent differential interaction of transcription factors NF-kappa B and N-myc to their respective sequences and they act as positive and negative regulator, respectively of GLT-1 gene expression in the brain during early developmental period in both cerebral and cerebellar cortices which might be different in aging of mice.","[Gupta, Rajaneesh Kumar; Prasad, S.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Adv Study Zool, Mol Biol & Biochem Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Prasad, S (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Adv Study Zool, Mol Biol & Biochem Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",s.sprasadbhu@gmail.com,"Gupta, Rajaneesh/AAD-5893-2019","Gupta, Rajaneesh/0000-0003-0212-6478","CSIR [09/013 (0111) 2007-EMR I, 37/1389/09/EMR-II]; BRNS, Govt. of India [2009/37/55/3298]","CSIR(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India); BRNS, Govt. of India(Department of Atomic Energy (DAE)Board of Research in Nuclear Sciences (BRNS))","R.K.G. thanks CSIR for Junior and Senior Research Fellowships (File No: 09/013 (0111) 2007-EMR I).

The microbes were applied as seed coating in different combinations in two experimental sets and the pathogen was inoculated after 25 days of sowing in one set. Results revealed that microbe application led to higher growth in chickpea particularly in the triple microbe combination compared to their individual treatments and control. Similarly, pathogen challenged plants accumulated higher amount of phenolic compounds both at the site of attack of the pathogen i.e. collar region as well as leaves compared to unchallenged plants. All the bioagents were found to trigger the level of phenolic compounds at collar region in varying degrees as compared to the healthy control (A). However, the most effective treatment was D7 (combined application of PHU094, THU0816 and RL091 with pathogen challenge) among all the treatments. Shikimic acid was maximally induced amongst all the phenolic compounds. In leaves also, the most effective treatment was D7 where shikimic acid, t-chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, myricetin, quercetin and syringic acid were produced in higher amounts as compared to treatment B where the plants were challenged only with the pathogen.

The XRD pattern confirms the amorphous nature of CNT-glassy composites under investigation. The crystallization kinetics of CNT- Se90-xTe10Agx (x = 0, 5 and 10) glassy composites have been studied by using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) with different heating (5, 10, 15 and 20 K/min) rates under non-isothermal conditions. The glass transition temperature T-g, crystallization temperature T-c and overall activation energy for crystallization E-c have been determined. Also, order parameters n, m have been determined to study dimensionality of growth and nucleation during crystallization. The Vickers micro-hardness of samples under investigation is measured to see the effect of CNT incorporation in glassy systems. The results indicate that glass transition temperature and micro-hardness are enhanced for all investigated glassy systems after incorporation of CNT. The enhancement of these parameters with CNT content could be explained on the basis of increase in cross-link density due to modification of chemical bond formation in glassy system with CNT content, which is also confirmed from Raman spectra of investigated glassy composites.

Plants were established in a mixture with proportions of 4:0, 3:1, 2:2, 1:3 and 0:4 (wheat:weed) plants per pot. The weeds exhibited clear differences in growth attributes and competition indices from wheat. Rumex dentatus showed significantly higher values for all growth attributes, relative yield, aggressivity and biomass. Both weeds performed better than wheat at high nutrient levels. Nutrient stress changed the intensity of competition between weeds and wheat, but did not change the weeds' positions in the hierarchy. Therefore, although the competitiveness of P.minor and R.dentatus appears to be lower under poor nutrient conditions, they outcompete wheat irrespective of nutrient availability.

Rhythms were accurate (6.02 in males/7.30 in females [h(-1)]) and precise (4.83 in males /4.74 in females [h(-1)]). Fifteen-minute perturbations with approximate to 70lux white light in DD led to predictable phase advances and delays.

Incubation of post-vitellogenic follicles with VT resulted in significant increases of both PGF(2 alpha), and PGE(2) at 8 and 16 h intervals. The rise was higher at 16 h except in the 1000 nM VT group, in which the PG levels decreased compared to the 100 nM group (biphasic effect). VT was more effective to increase the PG levels in comparison to hCG or IT. The co-incubation of the follicles with both hCG (20 IU/ml) and VT (100 nM) increased significantly PGF(2 alpha), level at 8 h, higher than that elicited by each when incubated alone. Pre-incubation of the follicles with V-1 receptor antagonist, alone or in co-incubation with VT, significantly inhibited the VT-stimulated PGF(2 alpha) and PGE(2) levels. Under similar conditions, V-2 receptor antagonist did not affect the PGE(2) levels. Both VT (100 nM) and PGs stimulated FOM (germinal vesicle breakdown) and ovulation in a dose- and duration dependent manner, PGF(2 alpha), was more effective. Incubation of postvitellogenic follicles with indomethacin (a non selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor) per se did not affect FOM and ovulation but significantly decreased VT and PG effects upon pre-incubation. The results suggest that the VT stimulation of PGs may be mediated mainly through the V-1 receptor though the involvement of V-2 receptor cannot be excluded. The article also discussed the positive interplay of gonadotropin, maturation-inducing steroid, VT and PG during FOM and ovulation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[Joy, K.

Electrostatic interactions along with complementary H-bonding and other hydrophobic interactions inducing additional synergetic effect between the template (aspartame) and the imprinted surface led to the formation of imprinted sites. The MIP was able to selectively and specifically take up aspartame from aqueous solution and certain pharmaceutical samples quantitatively.

Cloning and sequencing of amplified PCR fragment from P. aeruginosa SDS3 confirmed presence and identity of sdsA1 gene. Sequence analysis revealed 98% identity with the sdsA1 gene sequence of the reference strain, P. aeruginosa PAW. However, BLAST search showed the presence of orthologs of sdsA1 gene in other species of Pseudomonas. Identity of alkyl sulfatase from strain SDS3 was proven on protein level. Protein band of alkyl sulfatase (retrieved after zymography) showed close identity to alkyl sulfatase (SdsA1) of P. aeruginosa PA01 in MALDI-TOF MS analysis. RT-PCR assay revealed inducible transcription of sdsA1 gene in P. aeruginosa strain SDS3.

In the modeling process, it is assumed that the density of forestry biomass depletes due to the presence of human population and it is being conserved by applying some technological efforts. The analysis of model shows that the density of forestry biomass may be conserved if the technological effort is applied within the appropriate time. A longer delay in applying technological effort for its conservation destabilizes the system.

Method: Twenty patients with lupus nephritis flare were included in the study. Ten patients in each group of stable systemic lupus erythematosus and non-renal flare were taken as controls. Biopsy was done to define lupus nephritis stage. UMCP-1 levels were measured in all patients at the time of entry and at four and eight weeks of follow-up. Results: Mild, moderate and severe lupus nephritis flare was noted in one, five and 15 patients, respectively. UMCP-1 levels were high in patients with severe lupus nephritis flare (2.74 +/- 0.95 ng/mg creatinine) as compared to patients with moderate (1.43 +/- 0.46 ng/mg creatinine) and mild lupus nephritis flare (0.76 +/- 0.57 ng/mg creatinine) (P = 0.0093). Baseline mean UMCP-1 levels in lupus nephritis flare, non-renal flare and stable SLE patients were 2.32 +/- 1.06, 0.171 +/- 0.03 and 0.213 +/- 0.026 ng/mg creatinine, respectively. The difference among the three groups was very significant (P < 0.001). Also, mean UMCP-1 levels correlated significantly with severity of lupus nephritis class (P = 0.0358). During follow-up, 15 patients achieved complete or partial remission, and in these patients mean UMCP-1 levels had significant decline at eight weeks (P < 0.0001). However, mean UMCP-1 levels in the remaining five non-responders did not show significant changes at four and eight weeks (P = 0.4858). Conclusion: Mean UMCP-1 levels were significantly higher in the lupus nephritis flare group as compared to non-renal flare and stable patients. Baseline mean UMCP-1 levels significantly correlated with both lupus nephritis class and severity of lupus nephritis flare, hence UMCP-1 could be used as a non-invasive marker for the judgement of lupus flare and lupus nephritis class.

We have addressed this problem in this paper by using water soluble functional monomers for preparing an imprinted polymer network. Here, silica gel was used as the supporting matrix and preparation of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP) for baclofen (4-amino-3-p-chlorophenylbutyric acid), a skeletal muscle relaxant, was carried out on the surfaces of silica gel. An imprinting network of sulfobetaine polyelectrolyte was prepared in aqueous medium only, which was grafted onto the silica gel matrix using (3-aminopropyl) triethoxy silane as a silane coupling agent and Michael addition reaction for further propagating the polymer grafting procedure. Thus prepared MIPs were characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), providing evidence for the quality and quantity of grafted films. The binding studies showed that the MIP illustrated good recognition for baclofen as compared to non-imprinted polymers (NIPs). Meanwhile, selectivity experiments demonstrated that MIP had a high affinity to baclofen in the presence of close structural analogues (interferrants). Hence, a facile, specific, selective and water-compatible technique to detect baclofen in the presence of various interferrants is presented here and moreover these materials can be applied in HPLC as well as in capillary electrochromatography (CEC) and in addition they can be applied to different template targets.","[Tarannum, Nazia; Singh, Meenakshi] Banaras Hindu Univ, MMV, Dept Chem, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Singh, M (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, MMV, Dept Chem, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",meenakshi_s4@rediffmail.com,"TARANNUM, NAZIA/A-9456-2012; Singh, Meenakshi/I-6855-2013","Singh, Meenakshi/0000-0002-5909-8757","University Grants Commission, New Delhi; Department of Science and Technology, New Delhi [SR/S2/CMP-65/2007]","University Grants Commission, New Delhi(University Grants Commission, India); Department of Science and Technology, New Delhi(Department of Science & Technology (India))","The work is financially supported by the University Grants Commission, New Delhi and Department of Science and Technology, New Delhi grant [SR/S2/CMP-65/2007].",,54,14,15,0,61,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",1759-9660,1759-9679,,ANAL METHODS-UK,Anal.

E. aerogenes free cells grown on cheese whey diluted to 10 g lactose/L, had maximum lactose consumption (similar to 79%), high production of acetic acid (1,900 mg/L), butyric acid (537.2 mg/L) and H-2 yield (2.04 mol/mol lactose; rate,1.09 mmol/L/h). The immobilized cells improved lactose consumption (84%), production of acetic acid (2,100 mg/L), butyric acid (718 mg/L) and also H-2 yield (3.50 mol/mol lactose; rate, 1.91 mmol/L/h). E. aerogenes spent medium (10 g lactose/L) when subjected to photofermentation by free Rhodopseudomonas BHU 01 cells, the H-2 yield reached 1.63 mol/mol acetic acid (rate, 0.49 mmol/L/h). By contrast, immobilized Rhodopseudomonas cells improved H-2 yield to 2.69 mol/mol acetic acid (rate, 1.87 mmol/L/h). The cumulative H-2 yield for free and immobilized bacterial cells was 3.40 and 5.88 mol/mol lactose, respectively. Bacterial cells entrapped in alginate, had a sluggish start of H-2 production but outperformed the free cells subsequently. Also, the concomitant COD reduction for free cells (29.5%) could be raised to 36.08% by immobilized cells. The data suggest that two-step fermentative H-2 production from cheese whey involving immobilized bacterial cells, offers greater substrate to- hydrogen conversion efficiency, and the effective removal of organic load from the wastewater in the long-term.","[Rai, Pankaj K.; Singh, S.

Lattice calculations provide such EOS for the strongly interacting matter at finite temperature (T) and vanishing baryon chemical potential (mu(B)). These calculations are of limited use at finite mu(B) due to the appearance of notorious sign problem. In the recent past, we had constructed a hybrid model description for the QGP as well as HG phases where we make use of a new excluded-volume model for HG and a thermodynamically-consistent quasiparticle model for the QGP phase and used them further to get QCD phase boundary and a critical point. Since then many lattice calculations have appeared showing various thermal and transport properties of QCD matter at finite T and mu(B) = 0. We test our hybrid model by reproducing the entire data for strongly interacting matter and predict our results at finite mu(B) so that they can be tested in future. Finally we demonstrate the utility of the model in fixing the precise location, the order of the phase transition and the nature of CP existing on the QCD phase diagram. We thus emphasize the suitability of the hybrid model as formulated here in providing a realistic EOS for the strongly interacting matter.","[Srivastava, P. K.; Singh, C.

In this study a PCR technique was applied targeting the 18S rRNA encoding region to determine the prevalence of Leishmania infection in female P. argentipes captured in the field. For this study, sand flies were collected from 897 houses selected from 50 villages endemic for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Muzaffarpur district, Bihar state, using CDC miniature light traps and mouth aspirators. A total of 14,585 sand flies were collected of which 449 were female P. argentipes divided into 132 pools. Molecular detection using PCR targeting the 18S rRNA gene was carried out for the identification of P. argentipes and Leishmania. The overall prevalence of infection was 4.90-17.37% for L. donovani in female P. argentipes in endemic regions of Bihar state. In this study no correlation was found between the presence of infected sand flies and the occurrence of clinical VL. This study provides the first report evaluating the prevalence of Leishmania infection in sand flies in a region endemic for VL in India. Sergentomyia species are the most common species of sand fly. Knowledge of the infection rate in female P. argentipes may help in predicting severity of disease and in vector elimination programs.","[Tiwary, Puja; Kumar, Dinesh; Singh, Rudra Pratap; Rai, Madhukar; Sundar, Shyam] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Med, Infect Dis Res Lab, Varanasi 221005, UP, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Sundar, S (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Med, Infect Dis Res Lab, Varanasi 221005, UP, India.",drshyamsundar@hotmail.com,"TIWARY, PUJA/F-3395-2012","TIWARY, PUJA/0000-0002-8180-2739","National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) DMID funding mechanism, Tropical Medicine Research Centre [P50AI074321]; Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, New Delhi, India; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES [P50AI074321] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) DMID funding mechanism, Tropical Medicine Research Centre; Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, New Delhi, India(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID))","We thank our entomology team members, KAMRC, and Muzaffarpur for help collecting and differentiating the sand fly samples.

Methods: A hospital-based prospective study was conducted of 80 children allocated randomly to receive prolonged (5-month) or standard (3-month) prednisolone therapy. They were followed quarterly for 12 months during which the numbers of relapses and steroid side effects were noted. Results: The mean relapse rate (0.63 vs. 1.54; p=0.011) and cumulative risk of relapse per patient per month (0.05 vs. 0.131) were significantly lower in the prolonged than the standard treatment. Total relapses in patients followed up for 12 months were significantly lower in the prolonged-therapy as compared with the standard-therapy group (21.6% vs. 70.2%; p=0.001). Cumulative percentage of patients with sustained remission at 12 months was significantly higher in the prolonged-therapy than the standard-therapy group (76% vs. 29%). Mean cumulative dose of prednisolone with prolonged therapy was significantly lower than with standard treatment (p=0.033).

Conclusions: A prolonged course of prednisolone therapy for an initial episode of nephrotic syndrome can be considered, as it reduces the rate of relapses without increasing the risk for steroid side effects.","[Mishra, Om P.; Thakur, Neha; Prasad, Rajniti] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Pediat, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Mishra, Rabindra N.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Community Med, Div Biostat, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Mishra, OP (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Pediat, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",opmpedia@yahoo.co.uk,"Thakur, Neha/AAD-6748-2020","Thakur, Neha/0000-0003-2374-7740",,,,,12,12,12,0,3,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1121-8428,1724-6059,,J NEPHROL,J.

It has been observed that HGNFs posses superior catalytic activity than other carbon nanoforms in improving the desorption kinetics and decreasing the desorption temperature of NaAlH4. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) reveals that HGNFs admixed NaAlH4 undergo hydrogen desorption at a much lower temperature than PGNFs and CNTs (SWCNTs and MWCNTs) admixed NaAlH4. Thus for the heating rate of 2 degrees C/min, the peak desorption temperature corresponds to initial step decomposition of NaAlH4 admixed with 2 wt.% HGNFs and 2 wt.% PGNFs has been lowered to 143.6 degrees C and 152.6 degrees C, respectively (for pristine NaAlH4, it is similar to 170 degrees C). In addition to the enhancement in desorption kinetics, the HGNFs admixed NaAlH4 undergoes fast rehydrogenation at the moderate condition. Microstructural investigation reveals that the HGNFs were present on the surface of NaAlH4 grains, whereas CNTs were tunneled into the grains of NaAlH4 suggesting a distinct catalytic behavior of different carbon nanovariants.

Methods: We used luzindole, a nonselective MT2R antagonist, and 4-phenyl-2-propionamidotetralin (4P-PDOT), a selective MT2R antagonist, to assess the potency of the melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 in melatonin-induced immunity under both in vivo as well as in vitro conditions. Results: Physiological doses (25 mu g/100 g body weight in vivo and 100 and 500 pg/ml in vitro) of melatonin upregulated both MT1R and MT2R expression as well as splenocyte proliferation, while higher doses (100 and 500 mu g/100 g body weight in vivo and 1 ng/ml in vitro) downregulated splenocyte proliferation and the expression of both receptors. Luzindole antagonized the expression of both MT1R and MT2R in a dose-dependent manner under in vivo as well as in vitro conditions, while 4P-PDOT blocked the expression of MT2R only during both experimental conditions. Splenocyte proliferation and IL-2 secretion (in vitro) followed the MT1R expression pattern, while the MT2R expression pattern showed no definite relation with either splenocyte proliferation or IL-2 secretion under in vivo and in vitro conditions. Conclusion: Immune function in tropical rodents is directly regulated by melatonin via its high-affinity membrane receptor MT1. MT1R plays a directive role in mediating splenocyte proliferation and IL-2 release, while the MT2R subtype appears not to be required for the immunoenhancing role of melatonin. Copyright (C) 2011 S.

Biomethanization process of coal begins with biodegradation of coal by specific bacteria and fungi. As a result of this, major polymers present in coal like proteins, polysaccharides, nucleic acids and lipids are hydrolyzed to monomers like aminoacids, sugars, purines, pyrimidines and long chain fatty acids. Their subsequent fermentation forms hydrogen, CO2 and a number of reduced compounds like alcohols, short chain fatty acids, organic acids and certain aromatics. The oxidation of these reduced compounds further leads to the formation of acetate, hydrogen and CO2, methylated compounds and several intermediate compounds. Syntrophic relationship exists between fermenting bacteria and methanogens. The resultant oxidized compounds of fermenting bacteria are gradually utilized by specific methanogens to form methane. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens utilize H-2 and convert CO2 into methane. Whereas acetate is utilized by acetoclastic methanogens to generate methane. The methylated compounds are utilized for methane formation by methylotrophic methanogens.","[Singh, Prakash K.; Singh, M.

The refractive index variation used in the beam coupling equations was calculated directly from the material rate equations via the total space charge field. The diffraction efficiency of the holograms recorded in photorefractive media is not only a function of the applied external electric field but also a function of crystal thickness, diffusion field, reduced fringe contrast modulation ratio and absorption coefficient of the materials. The effects of these parameters on the efficiency of the holograms have been studied in details. In the absence of the external applied field, it is found that the diffraction efficiency of the holograms could be maximized for a thinner photorefractive crystal having lower absorption coefficient and higher value of diffusion field, which could exist at a much lower value of reduced fringe contrast modulation ratio of the index grating. More efficient holograms can be recorded in the presence of the externally applied electric field as compared to the case of no external field. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

The diffusion coefficient (1.096 x 10(-5) cm(2) s(-1)), rate constant (7.308 s(-1)). and Gibb's free energy change (-12.59 kJ mol(-1)) due to analyte adsorption, were also calculated to explore the kinetics of AA oxidation.

Even though BPA is reported to produce reproductive and behavioral toxicity in experimental animals, the direct effect of BPA on the cardiovascular system is not known. The present study was therefore undertaken to evaluate the effect of BPA, on spontaneously beating rat right atrial preparations. In this study, in vitro isometric contractions of right atria were recorded. Cumulative concentration-response of BPA on atrial contractions was obtained in the absence or presence of antagonists. BPA (0.1-100 mu M) decreased the rate and the force of atrial contractions in a concentration-dependent manner. At 100 mu M, the decreases were >90%. The BPA-induced changes were not blocked by atropine (muscarinic receptor blocker). However, pretreatment with N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor) or methylene blue (a guanylyl cyclase inhibitor) blocked the BPA-induced changes in rate and force. Nitroglycerine, an NO-donor, decreased the rate and force of atrial contractions. Further, the BPA-induced changes were not due to the solvent (ethanol) used to dissolve it. The present study therefore indicates that BPA decreases the atrial contractility involving NO-dependent G-cyclase signaling mechanisms.

As tumor growth induces myelosuppression in tumor-bearing hosts, it remains unclear if PPI can also modulate tumor-induced myelosuppression. Thus, we studied the effect of in vivo administration of pantoprazole (PPZ), a PPI, on myelopoiesis in a murine model of a transplantable T cell lymphoma, designated as Dalton's lymphoma (DL). Intraperitoneal administration of PPZ to tumor-bearing mice resulted in an enhanced bone marrow cellularity, inhibited induction of apoptosis and augmented bone marrow cell (BMC) survival. BMC of PPZ-administered tumor-bearing mice showed elevated number of F4/80 positive cells, augmented colony forming ability and differentiation in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) with higher expression of F4/80 and CD11c markers. This study also presents evidences to indicate that PPZ-dependent augmentation of myelopoiesis in the tumor-bearing host is dependent on an enhanced expression of M-CSF and receptors for M-CSF & GM-CSF in BMC, along with a modulation in the expression of cell survival regulatory molecules PUMA, Bcl2, p53 and caspase-activated DNase (CAD). BMDM obtained from PPZ-administered tumor-bearing mice also showed an augmented expression of TLR-2, tumoricidal activity, production of NO and monokines:IL-1, IL-6 & TNF-alpha. The study discusses the possible mechanisms underlying PPZ-dependent augmentation of myelopoiesis. Taken together, the present study proposes that a PPZ-dependent alleviation of tumor-induced myelosuppression could contribute to an augmented myelopoiesis. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Keeping in view the negative impacts of synthetic insecticides and the demands of botanical pesticides, the present investigation explores the repellents, antifeedants, ovicidal, larvicidal and pupaecidal activity of two plant essential oils (EOs) and their major components, geranial and 1,8-cineole, when applied as fumigants for the management of the pulse beetle. RESULTS: EO of Callistemon lanceolatus (Sm.) Sweet caused 100% repellency of pulse beetle in a Y-shaped olfactometer at a dose of 150 mu L, while Lippia alba (Mill.) N.E. Brown EO and 1,8-cineole showed 76 and 74.7% repellency at the same dose. At 0.1 mu L mL(-1), both the oils and 1,8-cineole provided 100% insect mortality. The EO of C. lanceolatus was recorded as the most effective fumigant, showing 96.03% oviposition deterrency and 100% antifeedant activity at 0.1 mu L mL(-1). The LD50 of L. alba (11049.2 mu L kg(-1)) and C. lanceolatus (14626.3 mu L kg(-1)) exhibited their favourable safety profiles when recorded on mice. CONCLUSION: EOs of L. alba and C. lanceolatus exhibited significant biological activity on the mortality and reproductive behaviour of pulse beetle. Based on their high LD50 values, the oils could be safely recommended as non-mammalian toxic fumigants in management strategies for pulse beetle.

Although cholecystokinin (CCK) is a potent modulator of gallbladder contractility and plays a potential role in pancreatic carcinogenesis through CCK type-A receptor (CCKAR), its role in gallbladder cancer (GBC) is still unknown and inrimunohistochemical detection of CCKAR in the gallbladder has not yet been reported. This novel case-control study aimed to investigate the expression profile of CCKAR in GBC and gallstone disease (GSD). METHODS: This study included 162 samples of gallbladder: 94 from GBC and 68 from GSD. Expression of CCKAR was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. The results were statistically correlated with disease history including age, sex, presence of gallstone, stage and differentiation. RESULTS: CCKAR was positive in 30/68(44.1%) of GSD and 72/94 (76.6%) of GBC samples. Fifty-one of the 72 (70.8%) CCKAR-positive GBC samples showed over-expression. Interestingly, consistent results also appeared in the immunoblotting study. CONCLUSIONS: CCKAR expression was significantly increased in GBC compared to GSD. Moreover, CCKAR expression was associated with the degree of tumor differentiation, i.e., less expression in poorly-differentiated tumors. Thus, it has future prognostic and therapeutic implications in the management of GBC.","[Rai, Rajani; Tewari, Mallika; Shukla, Hari S.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Surg Oncol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Kumar, Mohan] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Pathol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Singh, Tej Bali] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Community Med, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Shukla, HS (corresponding author), 7 SKG Colony, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",harishukla@usa.net,,,Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) [3/2/2/187/2009/NCD-III],Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)(Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)),This work was supported by a grant from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR Project Ref No. 3/2/2/187/2009/NCD-III).,,33,14,15,0,7,ZHEJIANG UNIV SCH MEDICINE,HANGZHOU,"FIRST AFFILIATED HOSPITAL, 79 QINGCHUN ROAD, HANGZHOU, 310003, PEOPLES R CHINA",1499-3872,,,HEPATOB PANCREAT DIS,Hepatob.

Arsenite (As2O3; 25 and 50 mu M) treatment resulted in increased formation of superoxide anion (O (2) (.-) ), elevated levels of H2O2 and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, showing enhanced lipid peroxidation. An enhanced level of ascorbate (AA) and glutathione (GSH) was observed irrespective of the variation in the level of dehydroascorbate (DHA) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) which in turn influenced redox ratios AA/DHA and GSH/GSSG. With progressive arsenite treatment, synthesis of total acid soluble thiols and phytochelatins (PC) increased in the seedlings. Among antioxidative enzymes, the activities of superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1), catalase (EC 1.11.1.6), total ascorbate peroxidase (APX, EC 1.11.1.11), chloroplastic ascorbate peroxidase, guaiacol peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.7), monodehydroascorbate reductase (EC 1.6.5.4), and glutathione reductase (EC 1.6.4.2) increased in arsenite treated seedlings, while dehyroascorbate reductase (EC 1.8.5.1) activity declined initially during 5-10 days and increased thereafter. Results suggest that arsenite treatment causes oxidative stress in rice seedlings, increases the levels of many enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, and induces synthesis of thiols and PCs, which may serve as important components in mitigating arsenite-induced oxidative damage.","[Mishra, Shruti; Jha, A.

However, the population specificity of sexually dimorphic features is well known. The purpose of this study is to test the reliability of this trait in Indian population. A total number of 112 adult mandibles (88 males and 24 females) were studied from the Department of Forensic Medicine, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, India. The mandibles were scored according to the original method by two observers in three different sessions. This was done to test inter and intra-observer errors in identifying the trait. The result shows that this trait can be used to diagnose sex with an average accuracy of upto 82%. Though, inter and intra-observer errors were present but could be minimized with extended practice. So, the trait has the potential to be relied upon as a single morphological trait for determination of sex in Indian population. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine.

The identified protein (BHUP2) corresponds to a cytochrome c-like synthesis protein of 37 kDa. ELISA results were 94% sensitive, whereas specificities with sera from healthy controls from an area of endemicity, healthy controls not from an area of endemicity, and disease controls were 98%, 100%, and 97%, respectively.

Methods: f-CNTs were prepared in a two-step chemical carboxylation and amidation process. The AmB was then attached to make f-CNT-AmB and its construction was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The cytotoxicity of the constructed compound, f-CNT-AmB, was assessed in vitro using the J774A.1 macrophage cell line and in vivo using healthy BALB/c mice. Antileishmanial activity of AmB and f-CNT-AmB was assessed in vitro using a macrophage (J774A.1 cell line) model of Leishmania donovani infection. Antileishmanial activity was assessed in vivo by comparing the parasite load of hamsters treated with a 5 day course of AmB, f-CNTs or f-CNT-AmB initiated at 30 days after infection with L. donovani parasites. Results: The FTIR spectroscopy and TEM data demonstrate the successful attachment of AmB to f-CNTs. The in vitro cytotoxicity of AmB, f-CNTs and f-CNT-AmB was measured by the cytotoxic concentration required to kill 50% of the cells: 0.48 +/- 0.06 mu g/mL; 7.31 +/- 1.16 mu g/mL; 0.66 +/- 0.17 mu g/mL, respectively, in the J774A.1 cell line. The in vivo toxicity assessment of the compounds in BALB/c mice revealed no hepatic or renal toxicity. Against intracellular amastigotes the in vitro antileishmanial efficacy of f-CNT-AmB was significantly higher than that of AmB (IC50 0.00234 +/- 0.00075 mu g/mL versus 0.03263 +/- 0.00123 mu g/mL; P <= 0.0001). The percentage inhibition of amastigote replication in hamsters treated with f-CNT-AmB was significantly more than that with AmB (89.85% +/- 2.93% versus 68.97% +/- 1.84%; P = 0.0004). Conclusions: The results of these experiments clearly demonstrate that f-CNT-AmB has significantly greater antileishmanial efficacy than AmB and had no significant cytotoxic effects.","[Prajapati, Vijay Kumar; Gautam, Shalini; Rai, Madhukar; Sundar, Shyam] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Med, Infect Dis Res Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Awasthi, Kalpana; Yadav, Thakur Prasad; Srivastava, Onkar Nath] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Phys, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Sundar, S (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Med, Infect Dis Res Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",drshyamsundar@hotmail.com,"Prajapati, Vijay K/M-8539-2013; Yadav, T P/A-3030-2012","Prajapati, Vijay K/0000-0001-6510-0596; Yadav, T P/0000-0001-9188-0338","CSIR; DST (UNANST: BHU); NIAID, NIH [1P50AI074321]; ICMR (New Delhi, India); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES [P50AI074321] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","CSIR(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India); DST (UNANST: BHU)(Department of Science & Technology (India)); NIAID, NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID)); ICMR (New Delhi, India)(Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID))","CSIR and DST (UNANST: BHU) provided financial assistance.

Methods: Ninety-one adult patients with low back pain secondary to contained lumbar disc herniation were randomly assigned into two groups. Ozone group received intradiscal oxygen-ozone therapy (4 to 7 mL of oxygen ozone mixture); ozone-PIRFT group received a combination of oxygen-ozone therapy with PIRFT (radiofrequency lesioning at 80 degrees C for 360 s). Outcome Measures: Primary outcome measures included a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and the Oswestry disability index (ODI). Secondary outcome measures included pain relief, reduction of analgesic consumption, and patient's satisfaction. Clinical assessment of these outcome measures was performed at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after the procedure. Results: VAS scores and ODI were significantly decreased by both ozone and ozone-PIRFT when compared with the baseline values at all points of follow-up; however, ozone-PIRFT produced a significant reduction in the VAS scores and ODI when compared to ozone at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year follow-up.

Conclusion: Ozone-PIRFT is more efficacious than ozone alone in reducing pain scores, analgesic consumption, improving functional outcome, and satisfaction of patients with contained lumbar disc herniation.","[Gautam, Sujeet; Rastogi, V.; Jain, Ankur; Singh, A.

A large part of this formation is comprised of impure limestone and grey shale intercalations. The limestones contain sole marks, intraformational conglomerates, hummocky cross stratification and wave ripples. The occurrence of sole marks suggests that they are developed by the unidirectional currents at the initial phase of the storm that resulted erosion and subsequent deposition. The intraformational limestone conglomearate also suggests erosion of the earlier deposited limestone hardgrounds as a consequence of storm associated transgression. The hummocky cross stratification formed by the oscillatory flows during the long-shore littoral drift. The depth of formation of the hummocky cross stratified limestone facies was less than 40 m and most likely deposited between shore-face to backshore regions of the gulf similar to present day Persian Gulf. The identification of deeper facies (shelf facies) from Pakistan and coastal facies from India suggest that the gulf was open from the west and closed from the east.","[Singh, B. P.; Srivastava, A.

Twelve sampling stations were selected along a 20 km long stretch of the river. Mid stream sub-surface water samples collected at fortnightly intervals from all the sites were acid digested and analyzed for Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn. The data revealed that the mid-stream water of river Ganga at Varanasi is invariably contaminated by heavy metals. Highest concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni and Pb were recorded during winter and that of Zn during summer season. The overall concentration of heavy metals in water showed the trend : Zn > Ni > Cr > Pb > Cu > Cd. Concentrations of all the heavy metals were high in down - stream sampling stations. Correlation analysis showed that heavy metal concentration in mid-stream water had significant positive relationship with rate of atmospheric deposition at respective sites. Although the concentrations of these metals in water remained below the permissible limits of Indian standards for drinking water, levels of Cd, Ni and Pb at three stations, were above the internationally recommended (WHO) maximum admissible concentrations (MAC). These observations suggest that use of such water for drinking may lead to potential health risk in long-run. The study has further relevance in understanding the atmosphere - water interaction in polluted environment and for management of water bodies even those situated away from direct anthropogenic discharge.","[Pandey, J.; Shubhashish, K.; Pandey, Richa] Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Adv Study Bot, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Pandey, J (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Adv Study Bot, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",jiten_pandey@rediffmail.com,"Pandey, Richa/AAC-9596-2020","Pandey, Richa/0000-0003-1778-326X","University Grants Commission (UGC), New Delhi [F- 32 - 383/ 2006 (SR)]","University Grants Commission (UGC), New Delhi(University Grants Commission, India)","We thank Head, Department of Botany, Banaras Hindu University, for laboratory facilities.

With regard to the direct actions of GnRH agonist on ovary, conflicting data are reported. The mechanism through which GnRH agonist affect gonadal functions is still obscure. The aim of present study was thus to investigate the effects of treatment with different doses of GnRH agonist, in vivo and in vitro, on morphological, physiological and functional changes in the ovary of cyclic mice. Methods: To find out the effect of GnRH agonist on ovarian activity, cyclic mice were treated with different doses for 8 days and its effect on folliculogenesis (morphological changes in follicle, Estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor), steroidogenesis (circulating progesterone level, StAR, LH-receptor, 3b-HSD), luteinization (Morphology of corpus luteum) and apoptosis (caspase-3, PARP) were observed. To find the in vitro effects of GnRH agonist with or without LH on ovary of mice, changes in the expression of LH-receptor, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, 3b-HSD in the ovary and progesterone level in the culture media were investigated. Results: GnRH agonist treatment produced significant changes in ovarian mass, circulating steroids level and ovarian follicular development, steroidogenesis and apoptosis in the mice. GnRH agonist also caused dose dependent histological changes in follicular development and luteinization. The mice treated with different doses of GnRH agonist showed biphasic effects on steroid synthesis due to its effects on ovarian expression of LH-receptor, StAR, and 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase proteins. The high dose showed stimulatory effect, whereas pharmacological dose showed inhibitory effect on ovarian follicular development and steroidogenesis. The in vitro study generally showed inhibitory effects of GnRH agonist on ovarian activities, which may be reversed by the presence of LH. Conclusion: Both inhibitory and stimulatory effects found in the present study suggest that GnRH agonist is a versatile tool in the therapy of a variety of gynecological and non-gynecological conditions. This study suggests that the outcome of direct effect of GnRH-ag on ovary depends on LH-responsiveness.","[Singh, Padmasana; Krishna, Amitabh] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Krishna, A (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",akrishna_ak@yahoo.co.in,"Singh, Padmasana/B-3739-2009","Singh, Padmasana/0000-0002-2183-2397","UGC, New Delhi [F. 34-420/2008 SR]; CSIR, India","UGC, New Delhi(University Grants Commission, India); CSIR, India(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India)","We thank Dr. Marvin Karten, Contraceptive branch, NIH, USA for a generous gift of GnRH-agonist ([DTrp<SUP>6</SUP>, Pro<SUP>9</SUP>-NEt] GnRH).

The cathodoluminescence images reveal the complex, inhomogeneous internal structure having irregular-shaped core and overgrowths. Zircon grains have obliterated oscillatory zoning. SHRIMP U-Pb chronological results yield ages of 550+/-15 Ma and 530+/-50 Ma as a time of metamorphic overprint, and the age of 2509+/-12 Ma and 2509+/-30 Ma corresponding to a timing of protolith formation for sapphirine-bearing granulites and garnet-cordierite gneisses respectively. Zircon ages reflect that continental crust in the NW of Madurai region resulted from the recycling of Archaean protolith of an igneous origin similar to the preserved crust in the southern part of Dharwar craton. The present SHRIMP U-Pb zircon ages are in close agreement with earlier published Nd isotopic data which suggest an extended precrustal history of their protoliths. The abraded zircon grains indicate multiple recycling and repeated metamorphism that has ultimately resulted in present day continental crust exposed in Madurai region. These SHRIMP U-Pb zircon ages from metapelitic UHT granulites are also significant to understanding the architecture of the SGT during the amalgamation of Gondwana in Neoproterozoic time.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Adv Study Geol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Prakash, D (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Adv Study Geol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",dprakashbhu@yahoo.com,,"Prakash, Divya/0000-0002-1408-2671","University Grants Commission, New Delhi [P-01-614]","University Grants Commission, New Delhi(University Grants Commission, India)","This work was financially supported by the University Grants Commission, New Delhi, under a major research project (P-01-614).

The enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) catalyses the formation of folate intermediates that are vital for DNA synthesis and methylation reactions. C677T and A1298C variants of MTHFR result in reduced plasma folate and increase the susceptibility to various multifactorial disorders. We have already shown that homozygosity for 677 (C -> T) mutation in the MTHFR gene, is a risk factor for idiopathic male infertility in an Indian population. Aim: Recently, we showed that homozygosity for the 677(C -> T) mutation in the MTHFR gene is a risk factor for idiopathic male infertility and now we aim to assess whether the A1298C mutation in the same gene is an additional risk factor for idiopathic male infertility in an Indian population. Setting and Designs: In a case-control study 151 idiopathic male infertile patients and 140 healthy fertile control individuals were recruited from the University hospital and infertility clinics in Varanasi city, India. Materials and Methods: Genotyping for A1298C change of the MTHFR gene was done by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Statistical Analysis: Allele frequencies were calculated using Fisher's exact test. Odds ratio was calculated as the measure of the association between the MTHFR genotype and idiopathic male infertility. Results: The homozygous (C/C) A1298C polymorphism of the MTHFR gene was present at a statistically high significance in idiopathic azoospermic infertile men (OR=3.4494, CI: 1.0092 to 11.7899, P<0.05). Conclusion: The MTHFR 1298CC genotype is an additional genetic risk factor for idiopathic male infertility in an Indian population.","[Singh, K.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Inst Med Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Singh, S.

We obtain the (anti-)BRST-invariant coupled Lagrangian densities that respect the above nilpotent symmetry transformations. We discuss, furthermore, this (anti-) BRST invariance in the language of the superfield formalism. One of the novel features of our present investigation is the observation that, in addition to the horizontality condition, we are theoretically compelled to invoke some other physically relevant restrictions in order to deduce the precise (anti-) BRST symmetry transformations for all the fields of a topologically massive 4D non-Abelian gauge theory.

Malviya janpriya (HUM 6)} plants by evaluating the growth, and yield responses, nutritional quality and heavy metal accumulation at different sewage sludge amendment (SSA) rates. Sewage sludge amendment modified the physico-chemical properties of soil by decreasing pH and increasing organic carbon, total iron and heavy metals. Plants showed increments in shoot length, leaf area and total biomass at all SSA rates, but root length increased only up to 9 kg m(-2) SSA rates. Plants grown at different SSA rates showed higher nutrients and heavy metals in seeds, but protein content declined. Sewage sludge application caused about 39, 76 and 60% more yield at 6, 9 and 12 kg m(-2) treatments, respectively. Concentrations of Pb and Ni in grains were higher than the Indian permissible limits at and above 9 kg m-2 and of Cd at 12 kg m(-2) SSA rates. The study suggests that SSA at a rate lower than 9 kg m(-2) may be recommended due to better fertilizing value for soil and promoting mung bean yield. Higher rate of sewage sludge application leads to elevated accumulation of heavy metals in seeds, which limits the suitability for human consumption. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

EDU treated plants showed significantly higher antioxidative defense, assimilation capability and reduced membrane lipid peroxidation, which led to better growth and significant yield increments compared to non-EDU treated ones. The magnitude of positive responses was highest at 150 mg L-1 EDU treatment at 60 DAG, representing the metabolically most active phase of root filling in carrot.

During this time, 45 patients were treated with 450 fractions of external beam radiotherapy in Phoenix unit. Results : The mean fraction duration, irradiation time and setup time were 9.55 minutes, 1.84 minutes and 7.66 minutes respectively. A mathematical workload model was derived using the average fraction duration time, total irradiation time and setup time of different types of treatment. A simple software program (Workload Calculation Chart) was also constructed in Microsoft Excel using the derived algorithm. The model based software program was tested and applied for one year and found that it can be used effectively to describe workload of teletherapy unit.

Here, we demonstrate that Rab11 is essential for normal organization of ommatidial cells and their survival in Drosophila, and a mutation in this gene results in cytoskeleton disruption and activation of JNK signaling in the eye. The spatial organization of various cell types in compound eye, viz., cone, photoreceptor, pigment and bristle cells, were disrupted in Rab11 mutants as revealed by immunostaining of F-actin and adherens and septate junction proteins. Genetic interaction studies indicated that mutation in Rab11 upregulates Drosophila apoptotic genes, rpr, hid and grim. In order to study the pathway that causes excessive cell death in Rab11 mutants, the JNK pathway was chosen and genetic interaction analyses were carried out between Rab11 and candidates of the JNK signaling pathway. A downregulation of JNK signaling rescued the phenotype in Rab11 mutant eyes significantly while overexpression of JNK in the eyes using UAS-eiger, UAS-dtak1 or EP(2)0578, resulted in enhancement of the eye phenotype indicating a link between Rab11 and the JNK signaling pathway.

Quantitative content analysis was carried out on the data, data were analysed in order to project literature growth, authorship pattern, gender pattern, cited references pattern and related bibliometric phenomena. The analysis indicates that there were as many as 1636 articles published during 2000-2004 with an average increment of 23.75 articles per year. The authorship pattern indicates that team research has not been very common in LIS OA publishing and male authors were keener than female authors. Authors from academic institutions were paid more interest in OA publishing and most of them were from developed nations. The subject coverage of these OA e-journals was very vast and almost all facets of information and library science were covered in these articles. There were 90.10% of articles of these e-journals contained references and on an average an article contained 24 references. Of these, 38.53% of references were hyperlinked and 87.35% of hyperlinked references were live during investigation. The analysis of data clearly indicates that OA e-journals in LIS are rapidly establishing themselves as a most viable media for scholarly communication.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Lib & Informat Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Mukherjee, B (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Lib & Informat Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",mukherjee.bhaskar@gmail.com,"White, Howard D/A-7034-2009","Mukherjee, Bhaskar/0000-0003-2077-6976",,,,,43,17,17,1,74,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0138-9130,,,SCIENTOMETRICS,Scientometrics,JUL,2009,80,1,,,,,167,194,,10.1007/s11192-008-2055-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-008-2055-2,,,28,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Information Science & Library Science",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science,462PM,,,,,2022-12-21,WOS:000267368100010,View Full Record in Web of Science

The present study was conducted to evaluate the interactive effects of supplemental UV-B (sUV-B: 280-320 nm) and mineral nutrients on a leafy vegetable amaranthus (Amaranthus tricolor L. var Pusa badi) under natural field conditions in a dry tropical environment. The nutrient treatments were recommended dose of NPK, 1.5 times recommended dose of NPK, 1.5 times recommended dose of N and 1.5 times recommended dose of K sUV-B radiation inhibited growth and biomass accumulation and altered the patterns of biomass partitioning. In K amended plants larger proportion of biomass has been translocated to roots which further increased under sUV-B treatment. The application of 1.5 times recommended dose of NPK reduced the magnitude of yield loss. The study shows that amaranthus is a potentially UV-B sensitive species and a higher NPK dose above the recommended is required to minimize the adverse impact of sUV-B. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore there is an urgent need to develop new bactericides. Silver nanoparticles are the metal of choice as they hold the promise to kill microbes effectively. Silver nanoparticles take advantages of the oligodynamic effect that silver has on microbes. In this work we have synthesized silver nanoparticles using environmentally benign material like Mentha Piperita leaf extract. In the process of synthesizing silver nanoparticles we observed a rapid reduction of silver ions leading to the formation of stable crystalline silver nanoparticles in the solution.

METHODS A total of 30 patients underwent Urethroplasty for anterior urethral strictures using dorsal on-lay of a LMG from March 2006 to December 2006. Most patients had balanitis xerotica obliterans as the etiology. RESULTS The mean stricture length was 10.2 cm (range 3.7-16.5). Postoperatively, all patients underwent pericatheter urethrography at 3 weeks, followed by retrograde urethrography with micturating cystourethrography, and unflowmetry at 3 and 6 months. Repeat uroflowmetry was done as, and when, required. The mean period of follow-up was 9 months (range 4-12). The overall Success rate was 83.3%. The mean peak flow rate increased postoperatively from 4.36 mL/s to 35.5 mL/s at 3 months and 25.06 mL/s at 6 months Of follow-up. One patient developed repeat stricture at the anastomotic site, and 4 patients developed recurrent meatal stenosis. CONCLUSIONS The results of LMG Urethroplasty were comparable to that of buccal mucosal graft urethroplasty. LMG is easy to harvest.

A total of 215, 200, 261, 229 and 99 spots were clearly visible in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) gels of the cyanobacterium from the control and those subjected to 1 h treatment at the above temperatures, respectively. Proteomic analysis using 2DE, MALDI-TOF MS/MS and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of Anabaena exposed to the above temperatures displayed significant and reproducible alterations in 13 proteins homologous to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA), fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), keto-acid reductoisomerase, phycocyanin-alpha-chain, peroxiredoxin, ATP synthase-beta-chain, RNA binding protein, nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK), GroES, phycoerythrocyanin-alpha-chain, AhpC/TSA family and phycobilisome rod-core linker (PBS-RCL) protein. Except Prx, GroES and ATP synthase-beta-chain, other metabolic and oxidative stress proteins were down-regulated at temperatures over 48 degrees C. The down-regulation of FBA, GAPDH, and FBPase beyond 48 degrees C possibly disrupted glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway and the Calvin cycle, thereby leading to the death of Anabaena above 48 degrees C. Notwithstanding the above, an appreciable down-regulation of NDPK (involved in protein phosphorylation) and AhpC/TSA (specific scavenger of reactive sulphur species), may lead to loss of signalling and accumulation of reactive sulphur species, respectively, which contribute further to temperature stress. Appreciable induction of heat-shock proteins (HSPs), required for maintenance of metabolic proteins during thermal stress, as well as metabolic proteins up to 48 degrees C and their down-regulation at 53 degrees C and 58 degrees C suggested a close interlinking of these proteins. However, down-regulation of HSP60, HSP26 and HSP 16.6 appears to be responsible for cell death.","[Mishra, Yogesh; Bhargava, Poonam; Chaurasia, Neha; Rai, Lal Chand] Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Adv Study Bot, Algal Biol Lab, Mol Biol Sect, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Rai, LC (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Adv Study Bot, Algal Biol Lab, Mol Biol Sect, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",lcrai@bhu.ac.in,"Mishra, Yogesh/AAI-3004-2021",,CSIR; UGC,"CSIR(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India); UGC(University Grants Commission, India)","L.C.

DNA damage activates and stabilizes p53 in nucleus and cytoplasm and regulates other proteins that stimulate intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. Apoptosis is morphologically distinct from that of necrosis and both the phenomena depend on the types, developmental stages, physiological environment of tissues and the nature of death signal. Malfunctioning of apoptotic pathway may cause human diseases like cancer, neurodegenerative and autoimmune disorders. Recently, potent apoptosis-inducing compounds associated with human health have been recorded that prevent tumor promotion, progression, and the occurrence of cellular inflammatory responses. Certain photosensitizing drugs are being employed in photodynamic therapy to induce apoptosis for the treatment of cancer and non-cancerous cells. This review emphasizes the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis, associated diseases and certain therapeutic agents implicated in the elimination of malignant cells.","[Rastogi, Rajesh P.; Richa; Sinha, Rajeshwar P.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Adv Study Bot, Lab Photobiol & Mol Microbiol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Sinha, RP (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Adv Study Bot, Lab Photobiol & Mol Microbiol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",r.p.sinha@gmx.net,"Sinha, Rajeshwar/CAC-2606-2022","Sinha, Rajeshwar/0000-0002-0112-6161","UGC, New Delhi, India","UGC, New Delhi, India(University Grants Commission, India)","RPR gratefully acknowledges the UGC, New Delhi, India for providing financial assistance in the form of a fellowship.",,168,73,79,0,32,EXCLI JOURNAL MANAGING OFFICE,DORTMUND,"LEIBNIZ RESEARCH CENTRE WORKING ENVIRONMENT & HUMAN FACTORS EXCLI JOURNAL, ARDEYSTR 67, DORTMUND, D-44139, GERMANY",1611-2156,,,EXCLI J,EXCLI J.,,2009,8,,,,,,155,181,,,,,,27,Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,484WB,,,,,2022-12-21,WOS:000269078200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Classical approach for primary repair of TEF with EA is right thoracotomy with extrapleural approach, ligation of the azygos vein, identification and ligation of tracheoesophageal fistula, identification of upper esophageal pouch and end-to-end anastomosis. This study was conducted to evaluate if the ligation of the azygos vein is a must during primary repair of TEF with EA. Method: We studied 50 randomly selected cases in the last two years (Jan 2003-Jan 2005). In 25 babies (group A), primary repair was done with preservation of the azygous vein while 25 babies (group B) were operated with a classical approach with ligation and division of the azygos vein. The postoperative result was comparative in both cases. Result: Postoperative pneumonitis was higher in the babies operated with the classical approach (56% in group B and 12% in group A) and was found to be statistically significant. In postoperative complication, anastomotic leak was slightly higher in group B but was not statistically significant. Mortality rate was similar in both groups. Babies in group A were hemodynamically more stable in comparison to group B. Conclusion: Preservation of the azygos vein maintains the normal venous drainage of mediastinum and hence decreases the postoperative chest congestion and pneumonitis in the postoperative period in cases of congenital esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula, so it should be preserved whenever possible.","Banaras Hindu Univ, IMS, Dept Pediat Surg, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Gangopadhyaya, AN (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, IMS, Dept Pediat Surg, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",gangulybhu@rediffmail.com,"Pandey, Anand/I-5953-2019","Pandey, Anand/0000-0003-3514-0225; sharma, shiv prasad/0000-0001-6414-5450",,,,,7,16,17,0,5,GEORG THIEME VERLAG KG,STUTTGART,"RUDIGERSTR 14, D-70469 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0939-7248,1439-359X,,EUR J PEDIATR SURG,Eur.

Further, immunomodulatory property of melatonin is well documented in seasonally breeding animals. Present study elucidates the interaction of peripheral melatonin with seasonal pattern of immunity and reproduction in Indian tropical male bird Perdicula asiatica. Significant seasonal changes were noted in pineal, testicular and immune function(s) of this avian species. Maximum pineal activity along with high immune status was noted during winter mouth while maximum testicular activity with low immune status was noted in summer. During summer month's long photoperiod suppressed pineal activity and high circulating testosterone suppressed immune parameters, while in winter short photoperiod elevated pineal activity and high circulating melatonin maintained high immune status and suppressed gonadal activity. Therefore, seasonal levels of melatonin act like a major temporal synchronizer to maintain not only the seasonal reproduction but also immune adaptability of this avian species.

The expression is controlled by an array of positive and negative cis-acting elements present up to 1 kb upstream of its transcription start site. Our findings presented in this communication indicate that a well-characterized repressor element may be involved in active repression of the gene during aging. At least two proteins bind to the 25-bp sequence used in the present study encompassing the COUP adjacent repressor (CAR) element. The binding of one of the transacting factor that interacts with the repressor element increases during aging. This is accompanied by a decrease in transcription of the gene. The binding of the factor-to-repressor element decreases when expression of the Ov gene is induced by steroid administration. The factor has an approximate molecular weight of 35 kDa and is a phosphoprotein. It loses its ability to bind to DNA upon dephosphorylation. This makes it a potential target of various kinases/phosphatases that relay the various developmental, tissue-specific, and hormonal cues. The other trans-acting factor is a single-strand specific protein that interacts with the repressor element in an age-independent manner. These two proteins acting in conjunction may be involved in the repression of the Ov gene in old female birds where the lower circulating level of steroid hormones may be acting as an age-related cue.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Mol Biol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Kanungo, MS (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Mol Biol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",kanungo@bhu.ac.in,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,2,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",1044-5498,1557-7430,,DNA CELL BIOL,DNA Cell Biol.,JAN,2007,26,1,,,,,44,54,,10.1089/dna.2006.0523,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/dna.2006.0523,,,11,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Cell Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Cell Biology; Genetics & Heredity,133RU,17263596,,,,2022-12-21,WOS:000244031500005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methylation pattern was examined at embryonic day 18.5 and adult in kidney and spleen while in the liver the same exercise has been done in 11.5 dpc, 18.5 dpc, 5 dpp and in adult. In the liver at 11.5 dpc, all the 47 contiguous sites (including a CpG island from 2035 to 2330 bp) at 5' regulatory region of HoxB5 were unmethylated. Random methylation commences from 18.5 dpc and continues in 5 dpp and in the adult. In the kidney at 18.5 dpc, 26 CpGs were examined (excluding the CpG island region) and all of them were unmethylated but the fetal spleen had at least a few sites considerably methylated. In the adult there was a low level methylation in the kidney, on the other hand, in the spleen, all the CpGs were methylated except a few sites and certain sites were totally methylated. Thus in the adult, the level of methylation was much higher than in the fetal stage. On the other hand semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the extent of expression of HoxB5 was higher in embryonic stages than in the adult. Thus HoxB5 is a good paradigm to support that the developmental methylation of HoxB5 and its expression pattern show an inverse correlation. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, investigations on sexual isolation between two sympatric sibling species, namely Drosophila ananassae and A pallidosa have been undertaken by employing four different choice conditions (multiple-, female-, male- and no-choice). Mating success was scored by direct observation in Elens-Wattiaux mating chamber. In all the four choice conditions, homogamic matings were more frequent than heterogamic ones, which indicates preferential mating between males and females of the same species. The values of isolation estimate in all the four techniques are close to zero, suggesting the presence of strong sexual isolation between these two sibling species. In female choice method, where the sex ratio was I female: 2 males, males of the two species differ in their mating success. Similarly, in male-choice method with sex ratio I male: 2 females, females of the two species differ in their mating success. However, in multiple- and no-choice methods where the sex ratio was 1: 1 (equal number of males and females), no difference was found in mating success of the two types of males and females. From these results, it is concluded that there is strong ethological isolation between D. ananassae and A pallidosa, which is not affected by different experimental conditions. However, mating propensity is influenced by sex ratio in these two sibling species.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Genet Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Singh, BN (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Genet Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",bnsingh@bhu.ac.in,,,,,,,37,15,17,0,7,INDIAN ACAD SCIENCES,BANGALORE,"C V RAMAN AVENUE, SADASHIVANAGAR, P B #8005, BANGALORE 560 080, INDIA",0011-3891,,,CURR SCI INDIA,Curr.

Lantana occurs in diverse habitats and on a variety of soil types, and its spread is encouraged by animal activities and by human disturbances, such as cultivation, road construction, and changes in fire regimes. Lantana is morphologically distinct in the different regions of its invasive range compared to those regions in its native range. The biological attributes contributing to the success of Lantana as an invader species include: fitness homeostasis, phenotypic plasticity, dispersal benefits from destructive foraging activities, widespread geographic range, vegetative reproduction, fire tolerance, better competitive ability compared to native flora, and allelopathy. Mechanical, chemical and biological options for the eradication and control of Lantana are available. It is emphasized that ecosystem-level consequences of Lantana invasion, particularly on the biodiversity of native flora, are little understood and studies are needed to fulfill this knowledge gap.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Bot, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Singh, JS (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Bot, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",gyan_1@rediffmail.com,"Raghubanshi, Akhilesh Singh/B-1798-2008; Raghubanshi, Akhilesh/GQA-4805-2022",,,,,,66,171,186,5,122,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1444-6162,1445-6664,,WEED BIOL MANAG,Weed Biol.

Alignment of nifH sequences from both North Indian and South Indian isolates with that of the related isolates revealed their closer affinity to alpha-rhizobia, suggesting that nif genes in the beta-rhizobia might have been acquired from alpha-rhizobia via lateral transfer during co-occupancy of nodules by alpha-rhizobia and progenitors of R. taiwanensis, members of the beta-subclass of Proteobacteria. Immunological cross-reaction of the bacteroid preparation of M. pudica nodules showed strong a positive signal with anti-dinitrogenase reductase antibody, whereas a weak positive cross-reaction was observed with free-living R. taiwanensis grown microaerobically in minimal medium with and without NH4Cl. In spite of the expression of dinitrogenase reductase under free-living conditions, acetylene reduction was not observed under N-free conditions even after prolonged incubation.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Fac Sci, Sch Biotechnol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Tripathi, AK (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Fac Sci, Sch Biotechnol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",tripathianil@rediffmail.com,"Chowdhury, Soumitra Paul/AAA-5346-2020; Tripathi, Anil Kumar/AAP-8558-2020","Chowdhury, Soumitra Paul/0000-0002-8576-8857; Tripathi, Anil Kumar/0000-0001-5662-3344",,,,,50,33,34,1,16,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4166,1480-3275,,CAN J MICROBIOL,Can.

Under the Deep Continental Studies Project, two regional magnetic profiles over a stretch of 382 and 403 kill across the Chattisgarh region were carried out for the first time, in near east-west and north-south directions respectively. The Chattisgarh Basin recorded a broad magnetic high compared to Sakoli Belt and Dongargarh Supergroup in the west and Sonakhan Greenstone Belt in the east, which were reflected as lows on eitherside of the basin. Two-dimensional modelling of the data reveals a maximum thickness of 3000 m for the Chattisgarh sediments. The acidic and basic volcanic rocks associated with Sakolis, Dongargarh, Sonakhan Greenstone belt and Kondagaon Granulite belt were demarcated and their geometry deciphered. The Indravati sediments along north-south profile indicate a maximum thickness of 2500 in. Besides this, modelling of magnetic data also reveals the presence of possible intrusives into the Chattisgarh and Indravati sediments / basement. Based on the model results and available geological information all attempt is made to study the nature of the upper crust beneath the Chattisgarh basin. It appears that the detritus to the basin sediments is derived from the basic rocks in the centre, around Raipur while the peripheries are of granitic / acidic nature indicating a ring-type structure.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Geophys, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Srinivas, S (corresponding author), Plot 12,SR Nagar Post, Hyderabad 500038, Andhra Pradesh, India.",,,,,,,,26,3,3,0,3,GEOLOGICAL SOC INDIA,BANGALORE,"#64 12TH CROSS, BASAPPA LAYOUT P B 1922, GAVIPURAM PO, BANGALORE 560019, INDIA",0016-7622,,,J GEOL SOC INDIA,J.

During the course of the present study, female remating behaviour of six species of Drosophila, D. ananassae, D. nasuta, D. eugracilis, D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D. pseudoananassae was observed and compared. Periodic confinement design (2 h daily observation) was used for female remating experiments. The frequency of female remating ranges from 16 (D. eugracilis) to 82% (D. melanogaster) in different species of Drosophila, and the differences among different species are statistically significant. Remating latency also varies from 5.51 days (D. melanogaster) to 9.85 days (D.pseudoananassae) in different species, and variation among different species is statistically significant. Duration of copulation in first (virgin mating) and second (remating) matings was observed and compared in each of the six species. Among all the species tested, females of D. ananassae, D. nasuta, D. eugracilis, and D. pseudoananassae show significantly shorter duration of copulation in the second mating compared to the first mating, while D. simulans females show shorter duration of copulation in the second mating compared to the first mating, but the difference is statistically not significant. However, D. melanogaster females show significantly longer duration of copulation in the second mating compared to first mating. Based on these findings, it may be suggested that different species of Drosophila may vary in the incidence of remating and duration of copulation due to differences in their reproductive biology and adaptation.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Genet Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Singh, BN (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Genet Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",bnsingh@banaras.ernet.in,Singh/B-7614-2008,Singh/0000-0001-6545-583X,,,,,49,30,31,2,31,CURRENT SCIENCE ASSN,BANGALORE,"C V RAMAN AVENUE, PO BOX 8005, BANGALORE 560 080, INDIA",0011-3891,,,CURR SCI INDIA,Curr.

Hypothyroidism induced by adding 0.03% thiourea to aquarium water holding the catfish for 7, 14 and 21 days decreased serum T-3 levels in a duration-dependent manner (Newman-Keuls' test; P<0.05) and inhibited TH activity in the brain regions. T-4 replacement in 21-day thiourea-treated fish restored and even elevated significantly serum T-3 levels as well as brain TH activity in a duration-dependent manner. In general, the changes in enzyme activity were higher in the forebrain regions than medulla oblongata and in the resting phase than preparatory phase. Kinetic studies by Lineweaver-Burk plots showed that the stimulatory effect following T-4 administration and T-4 replacement on TH activity was due to increased affinity of the enzyme for its cofactor (6,7-dimethyl-2-amino-4-hydroxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropteridine), as evident from a significant decrease in apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (K-m) and an increase in apparent velocity maximum (V-max). The TH inhibition due to the thiourea treatment can be related to decreased affinity of the enzyme for its cofactor, as evident from a significant increase in apparent K-m value and a significant decrease in V-max. These data clearly show that circulating levels of T-4/T-3 modulate brain TH activity by altering the kinetic properties of the enzyme, which, in turn, influence catecholaminergic activity and dependent functions.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Joy, KP (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",,"Joy, Keerikkattil/B-2905-2009; Chaube, Radha/AAA-8988-2021",,,,,,33,22,22,1,6,SOC ENDOCRINOLOGY,BRISTOL,"22 APEX COURT, WOODLANDS, BRADLEY STOKE, BRISTOL BS32 4JT, ENGLAND",0022-0795,,,J ENDOCRINOL,J.

On the basis of per mg protein released in vitro, the products of both microfilariae and adult females exhibited comparable activity but this was much higher than that of extract of microfilariae and adult females. Two collagenase enzymes with molecular masses of 50 kDa and 70 kDa were separated using DEAE-sepharose CL6B and Sephadex G-100 column chromatography. The 50 kDa and 70 kDa collagenase exhibited pH optima of 5.2 and 7.0, respectivly. Considering specific activity, the 50 kDa enzyme was found to contribute about ten times more collagenase activity as compared to the 70 kDa enzyme. An inhibition study revealed obvious differences between them. Thiol group inhibitors such as N-ethylmaleimide and leupeptin inhibited the 50 kDa enzyme but this was strongly activated by dithiothreitol, a thiol group stabilizer. Alternatively, the 70 kDa enzyme showed a sensitivity to a metal chelator and a serine group inhibitor indicating its metalloserine protease nature. The antifilarial drug diethylcarbamazine did not demonstrate any inhibition under in vitro conditions. Both enzymes were significantly inhibited by antibody IgG separated from Wuchereria bancrofti infected human sera, showing a possible immunoprotective role.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biochem, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Rathaur, S (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biochem, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",sushma@banaras.ernet.in,,,,,,,20,7,7,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0022-149X,1475-2697,,J HELMINTHOL,J.

The method is independent of any critical assumption and requires only the input values of 'optimized parameters' of the time-of-flight mass spectrometer employed for detecting the recoil ions. The method has been used to calculate the MTKE of argon recoil ions produced in 24 keV e(-)-Ar collisions. The results obtained are compared with those determined from a relation given by Olson (Olson R E 1979 J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Phys. 12 1843); the agreement between the two results is found to be reasonably good within the experimental uncertainty of the measurements. Further, from dependences of MTKE on charge state fractions F-r of recoil ions and on their charge states q, it is found that F-r varies with q as 1/q(4) for multiple ionization of atoms by impact of energetic electrons, unlike as 1/q(2) for multiple ionization of atoms by impact of energetic highly charged heavy ions.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Phys, Atom Phys Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Shanker, R (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Phys, Atom Phys Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",,,,,,,,20,7,7,0,3,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",0953-4075,,,J PHYS B-AT MOL OPT,J.

It is found that when copper concentration reaches to a value of 10 atomic percent with the composition corresponding to Al70Cu15Ni15, the decagonal phase starts yielding to give rise to vacancy ordered phase. When all cobalt is replaced by copper i.e. when the composition corresponds to Al70Cu15Ni15, the decagonal phase disappears and the only phase observed is the vacancy ordered phase. It can thus be said that copper substitution brings in decagonal to vacancy ordered (VOP) phase transition.

The induction of gallic, ferulic, and cinnamic acids was manyfold more than those in the control.

The frequency distribution of Genotypes, based on disease score ignoring the growth stages, differed from the distribution in which disease score was assessed on a similar growth stage. Two crosses each, between 'tall resistant x dwarf susceptible' and 'late resistant x early susceptible' genotypes, were made. The evaluation of homozygous resistant lines in the F-3, F-4 and F-5 generations of both crosses showed a wide range of plant height and days to maturity. These lines showed significant differences for plant height and days to maturity but did not show a significant difference for AUDPC values of spot blotch. The correlation coefficients for AUDPC versus plant height or days to maturity were weak, i.e., - 0.336 and 0.061, respectively.

Rainwater samples were collected on event basis and were analyzed for pH and concentration of H+ ion, cations and anions. The monthly variations in rainwater pH clearly indicate that early rainfall is more alkaline and as rainy season proceeds rainwater showed lower pH. The pH of rain from June to September varied from 6.6 to 4.8 at most polluted locality. Among different cations, Ca2+ showed maximum concentration followed by NH4+,Na+, Mg2+ and then K+, whereas among anions sulphate concentration was maximum followed by nitrate and then chloride. A significant positive correlation observed between sulphate and accumulated rainfall suggests that the source of sulphate is mainly the industrial activities. While the negative correlations of other cations with accumulated rain suggest their additional sources in the area.

When tested against certain green algae, cyanobacteria, heterotrophic bacteria and fungi, the toxin inhibited growth of only green algae and cyanobacteria. The toxin has been partially purified employing Thin layer chromatography (TLC) and High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) techniques and appears to be microcystin-LR (leucine-arginine). Both crude and purified toxins showed toxicity to mice, the clinical symptoms in test mice being similar to those produced by hepatotoxin. Purified toxin at a concentration of 50 mug ml(-1) caused complete inhibition of growth followed by cell lysis in Nostoc muscorum and Anabaena BT1 after 6 days of toxin addition. Addition of toxin (25 mug ml(-1)) to the culture suspensions of the Nostoc and Anabaena strains caused instant and drastic loss of O-2 evolution. Furthermore a marked reduction (about 87%) in the (CO2)-C-14 uptake was also observed at a concentration of 50 mug ml(-1). Besides its inhibitory effects on photosynthetic processes, M. aeruginosa toxin (50 mug ml(-1)) also caused 90% loss of nitrogenase activity after 8 h of its addition. Experiments performed with C-14-labelled toxin indicate that the toxin uptake by cyanobacterial cells occurs both in light and dark. These results demonstrate that the toxin is strongly algicidal and point to the possibility that it may have an important role in establishment and maintenance of toxic blooms of M. aeruginosa in freshwater ecosystems. The relative significance of the hepatotoxic effect and the algicidal effect of the toxin is discussed with reference both to survival and dominance of M. aeruginosa in nature.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Sch Biotechnol, Microbial Biotechnol Unit, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; Banaras Hindu Univ, Mahila Mahavidyalaya, Dept Bot, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Kumar, A (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Sch Biotechnol, Microbial Biotechnol Unit, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",kashok@banaras.ernet.in,,,,,,,28,92,117,3,50,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0959-3993,1573-0972,,WORLD J MICROB BIOT,World J.

The cathodic polarization curves were almost linear and similar in all binary and ternary solution mixtures and resembled that of the hydrogen evolution reaction. However, in ternary solution mixtures of H3PO4, H2SO4, and HCOOH, the shape of the curves indicated composite reactions of hydrogen and oxygen reduction. Anodic polarization curves showed active, passive, and transpassive behaviors in all the solution mixtures. When H2SO4, CH3COOH, or HCOOH was added to H3PO4, the aggressive nature of the binary solution mixtures toward the alloy was intensified in the same order. Thus, maximum corrosion was observed in the case of binary solutions of H3PO4 with HCOOH. However, in the ternary solution mixtures, the corrosion of the alloy decreased. In the transpassive region, a secondary current peak and cur-rent plateau were observed in most cases. However, electropolishing was not achieved in these solution mixtures.

Ultrasonically deposited precursor films corresponding to Ba2Ca2.2Cu3.3Ox(Ag-y) have been thalliated under high vacuum (similar to 10(-5) torr) at 890 degreesC to obtain single phase Tl-2223 films, An off-stoichiometric and unreacted pellet of composition Tl2.05Ba2Ca2Cu3Oz has been used as source of Tl. We have shown that oxygen ambient is not necessary for the growth of Tl-2223 phase. The as-thalliated films have T-c's in the range 123 K +/- 0.70 K. The T-c has been found to be independent of the addition of AgNO3 to the precursor, The zero field transport J(c) has been observed to be > 1.2 x 10(5) A/cm(2) at 77 K. Near T-c (110 K-122 K), J(c) has been observed to follow the power law J(c) proportional to (1 - T/T-c)(p), p approximate to 2, A power law with p approximate to 1.4 has been observed for the temperature range 70 K-110 K, An optimum doping of Ag has been observed to induce about 25% increase in J(c) and it also leads to uniform and enlarged grain growth, The surface morphology of Ag free samples contains plate like grains having arbitrary shapes, In contrast to this 0.35 Ag doped sample exhibits nearly rectangular plate like grains.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Phys, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Srivastava, ON (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Phys, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",,"Singh, H.

These speckles, which we name 'omega speckles', were distributed in the interchromatin space in close proximity to the chromatin. The only chromosomal site where hsr omega -n transcripts localized was the 93D locus or the hsr omega gene itself, The number of nucleoplasmic speckles varied in different cell types. Heat shock, which inhibits general chromosomal transcription, caused the individual speckles to coalesce into larger but fewer clusters. In extreme cases, only a single large cluster of hsr omega -n transcripts localizing to the hsr omega locus was seen in each nucleus. In situ immunocytochemical staining using antibodies against heterogenous nuclear RNA binding proteins (hnRNPs) like HRB87F, Hrp40, Hrb57A and SS revealed that, in all cell types, all the hnRNPs gave a diffuse staining of chromatin areas and in addition, were present as large numbers of speckles. Colocalization studies revealed an absolute colocalization of the hnRNPs and the omega speckles. Heat shock caused all the hnRNPs to cluster together exactly, following the hsr omega -n transcripts. Immunoprecipitation studies using the hnRNP antibodies further demonstrated a physical association of hnRNPs and hsr omega transcripts. The omega speckles are distinct from interchromatin granules since nuclear speckles containing serine/arginine-rich SR-proteins like SC35 and SRp55 did not colocalize with the omega speckles. The speckled distribution of hnRNPs was completely disrupted in hsrw nullosomics. We conclude that the hsr omega -n transcripts play essential structural and functional roles in organizing and establishing the hnRNP-containing omega speckles and thus regulate the trafficking and availability of hnRNPs and other related RNA binding proteins in the cell nucleus.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Cytogenet Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Lakhotia, SC (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Cytogenet Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",lakhotia@banaras.ernet.in,"Lakhotia, Subhash C/D-2058-2011","Lakhotia, Subhash C/0000-0003-1842-8411",,,,,66,122,126,1,10,COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",0021-9533,1477-9137,,J CELL SCI,J.

Gas exchange characteristics, biomass, and levels of photosynthetic pigments, flavonoids, catalase, peroxidase activity, and ascorbic acid were determined to evaluate the changes induced by enhanced levels of W-B irradiation. Gas exchange analysis indicated that one of the reasons for the decline in photosynthesis is stomatal limitation. Enhanced W-B also caused reductions in chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments after 60 days of exposure. Concentrations of UV-B absorbing pigments increased linearly with age. UV-B irradiation also increased phenolic compounds. Catalase activity decreased, while peroxidase activity increased in response to elevated UV-B. There was a decrease in total plant biomass and ascorbic acid content of plants exposed to UV-B. Thus, an enhanced level of UV-B irradiation over a long period has a cumulative unfavourable effect on a number of physiological and biochemical processes, leading to a reduction in dry matter production.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Bot, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Agrawal, M (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Bot, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",madhoo@banaras.ernet.in,,,,,,,39,25,31,0,7,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4026,,,CAN J BOT,Can.

Cadmium was readily absorbed by roots of growing seedlings and its localisation was greater in roots than shoots. Low translocation of cadmium from roots to shoots was observed. Seedlings exposed for 20 days under 500 mu mol/L Cd2+ in the medium showed accumulation of Cd2+ to a level far beyond the ambient. Under 500 mu mol/L Cd2+ in the growth medium about 2.2 to 2.8 mu mols Cd2+ g dry wt. equivalent to 245 to 311 ppm Cd2+ was observed in roots and 0.5 to 1.2 mu mol Cd2+ g(-1) dry wt. equivalent to 56 to 134 ppm Cd2+ was noted in shoots in 20-day-grown seedlings. One Cd2+ binding protein complex with an apparent molecular weight of 18 kDa was purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, Sephadex G-200 gel filteration and fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). This complex had 4 sulfhydryl groups per protein molecule. The specific Cd2+ content of the complex was 3.7 mu mol mg(-1) peptide. The results suggest that Cd2+ binds possibly with the help of 4-SH groups to the peptide in mercaptide bonds and that this complex, which has a comparatively higher molecular weight than conventional phytochelatins, helps in sequestration of excess Cd ions in rice plants.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biochem, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Dubey, RS (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biochem, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",,"Shah, Kavita/E-8926-2012",,,,,,35,46,52,0,3,GUSTAV FISCHER VERLAG,JENA,"VILLENGANG 2, D-07745 JENA, GERMANY",0176-1617,,,J PLANT PHYSIOL,J.

Different electric fields corresponding to 3, 6, 9, 15, and 21 V have been applied during the growth of the tubules. The estimate of the electric field corresponding to these voltages cannot be precisely evaluated in view of only approximately defined electrode dimensions. It has been observed that the application of electric field leads to the agglomerates (bundles) of nanotubules. The size, length, and alignment of these bundles varies with the strength of the applied electric field. The best results have been obtained with electric field corresponding to 6 V where the as-formed tubules are in parallel alignment and exist as bundles. As the electric field is increased, the alignment of tubules in the bundle becomes randomly oriented. The degree of randomness increases with increase of electric field after its optimum value corresponding to 6 V. The parallel alignment of the graphitic tubules is thought to result due to orientation of the tubule axis along the direction of the applied electric field corresponding to an optimum value (which for the present case is 6 V) of the impressed voltage.

The HDC combined with Lowdin charges, distributed continuously in three-dimension spherically and symmetrically, were shown to reproduce ab initio MEP features of molecules fairly well. This method of computing the MEP was applied to two molecules of pharmacological importance, namely, dimaprit and mustard gas.

These mass cultures and isofemale lines were maintained in food bottles in the laboratory for varying number of generations by transferring about 50 flies (females and males in equal number) in each generation. After several generations, all the laboratory populations were analysed chromosomally to determine the frequency of different inversions. The results indicate that all the laboratory populations remained chromosomally polymorphic due to the persistence of inversions which were originally present in the populations. The quantitative data on the frequency of inverted gene orders and the level of inversion heterozygosity in laboratory populations are compared with those in corresponding natural populations. This comparison clearly shows that there is a considerable increase in the frequency of inverted gene orders and the level of inversion heterozygosity in laboratory populations when compared with corresponding natural populations. This is most likely to be due to selective advantage of inversion heterozygotes under stringent competition in laboratory populations. Thus heterotic buffering is associated with chromosome inversions of Drosophila bipectinata.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Genet Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Singh, BN (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Genet Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",,,,,,,,38,4,5,0,3,BLACKWELL WISSENSCHAFTS-VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"KURFURSTENDAMM 57, D-10707 BERLIN, GERMANY",0947-5745,,,J ZOOL SYST EVOL RES,J.

In the present study, we have investigated the mechanism involved in the tumor cell cytotoxicity mediated by cisplatin and IFN-gamma treated macrophages, and the effector molecules involved therein. Peritoneal macrophages treated with cisplatin and IFN-gamma, when cocultured with different tumor cell types, caused tumor cell death by induction of apoptosis. Evidence for this was provided by percent specific DNA fragmentation assay, by specific pattern of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation detected by agarose gel electrophoresis and by microscopic examination of the cells, which revealed nuclear alterations, characteristic of apoptosis. The time kinetics studies of DNA fragmentation, loss in cell viability and apoptotic cell population showed linearity with time; most of the cells that underwent apoptosis were found to be viable even after 24 h co-culture. Macrophages induced apoptosis in tumor targets even in the absence of cell-to-cell contact, i.e. via diffusible effector molecules. In P815 cells, NO produced by cisplatin and IFN-gamma treated macrophages was found to induce apoptosis as addition of N-G-monomethyl L-arginine (L-NMMA), a specific inhibitor of NO synthase to the co-culture, prevented apoptosis in P815 cells. Further, direct treatment of P815 cells with the NO donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), resulted in apoptosis. In L929 cells, the effector molecule was found to be tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha as apoptosis was blocked by the addition of anti-TNF-alpha antibodies to the co-culture but the addition of L-NMMA or SNP had no effect. The study thus shows that cisplatin and IFN-gamma treated macrophages can kill tumor cells by extracellular release of effector molecules which act by inducing apoptosis in a target cell-specific manner.","BANARAS HINDU UNIV, SCH BIOTECHNOL, VARANASI 221005, UTTAR PRADESH, INDIA",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),,,,,,,,,28,23,24,0,3,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0959-4973,1473-5741,,ANTI-CANCER DRUG,Anti-Cancer Drugs,SEP,1997,8,8,,,,,797,806,,10.1097/00001813-199709000-00010,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00001813-199709000-00010,,,10,Oncology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Oncology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,YC862,9396625,,,,2022-12-21,WOS:A1997YC86200010,View Full Record in Web of Science

The present report shows that nanocrystalline particulate ZnO thin film electrodes sensitized by rhodamine B give excellent photoresponse in nonaqueous media under visible light illumination. Even by monochromatic light (lambda = 550 nm) of low intensity (300 mu W/cm(2)), high open-circuit photopotentials up to 280 mV were generated using these electrodes. Under short-circuit conditions, the maximum incident photons to current conversion efficiency was found to be 8.5% at the peak wavelength of 555 nm in acetonitrile medium. The electrodes were found to be fairly stable in nonaqueous solvents and gave considerably high conversion efficiencies and fill factors. These relatively high efficiencies are indicative of low recombination losses in nanocrystalline particulate film electrodes.","BANARAS HINDU UNIV,FAC SCI,DEPT CHEM,VARANASI 221005,UTTAR PRADESH,INDIA",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),,,,,,,,,48,53,55,0,30,ELECTROCHEMICAL SOC INC,PENNINGTON,"10 SOUTH MAIN STREET, PENNINGTON, NJ 08534",0013-4651,,,J ELECTROCHEM SOC,J.

A plot of the b(3)/b(1) value against surface number provides a simple graphical technique for assessing fold harmony. On such a diagram, a straight line parallel to abscissa denotes a strictly harmonic fold, while other lines and curves denote variation of fold shape from surface to surface. A new scheme of multilayered fold classification based on 'Index of Non-Harmony (INH)', which reveals the degree of variation in shape of different surfaces of the fold, is proposed. INH is obtained from standard deviation (sigma(n)) of b(3)/b(1) ratios of 'n' number of surfaces of a quarter wave sector. On the basis of values of INH (= 1000 . sigma(n)) the multilayered folds are classified as 'Strictly Harmonic' (INH = 0), 'Periharmonic' (0 < INH less than or equal to 15), 'Subharmonic' (15 < INH less than or equal to 30), 'Subnonharmonic' (30 < INH less than or equal to 45), 'Nonharmonic' (45 < INH less than or equal to 75) and 'Strongly Nonharmonic' (INH > 75). In a case study of polydeformed Precambrian rocks of central India, it is found that the index of nonharmony decreases in folds of later (younger) generations.

Analysis of variance was carried out on the data of hybrids and strains to detect the effect of male and female strains as well as interaction between sexes. Variation was highly significant for males, females and males x females interaction. Thus both sexes contribute to the variance of the next generation. The overall mean number of matings of F-1 hybrids was close to that of the original strains, which shows polygenic control of mating propensity, and a substantial amount of additive genetic variation in natural populations of D. bipectinata, which is reported for the first time in this species.

The incorporation of finite-size, hard-core, repulsive interactions in the thermodynamically consistent description of hot and dense hadron gas alters the results obtained for pointlike particles. We compare results in two extreme alternative cases: (1) K and K* mesons are treated as point particles and they can penetrate all volumes occupied by baryons and antibaryons and (2) the volume occupied by the baryons and antibaryons is not accessible to them.

With cultured N. cycadae and freshly isolated N. cycadae, NH3 production was enhanced by adding a host-tissue extract in the light or in the dark, whereas it was decreased by adding MSO. Nitrogenase activity was four times higher in coralloid root than in the cultured endophyte N. cycadae.

The abilities of RNI secretion and related tumouricidal activity against P815 mastocytoma cells were compared. These parameters were found to be closely correlated in various experiments. RNI secretion and generation of bone marrow macrophage-mediated tumouricidal activity were significantly inhibited by L-N-monomethyl arginine (L-NMMA), a specific inhibitor of the L-arginine pathway, but L-NMMA did not inhibit macrophage-mediated killing of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-sensitive Wehi cells, suggesting that activated macrophages exhibit at least two cytolytic mechanisms, one by L-arginine-dependent nitric oxide pathway and another by TNF-mediated killing. The present findings suggest that the mechanism of tumour cell killing by activated macrophages may differ, depending on the tumour cell type, and reactive nitrogen intermediates play a major role in cisplatin-mediated activation of bone marrow-derived macrophages.","BANARAS HINDU UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,VARANASI 221005,UTTAR PRADESH,INDIA",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"SODHI, A (corresponding author), BANARAS HINDU UNIV,SCH BIOTECHNOL,VARANASI 221005,UTTAR PRADESH,INDIA.",,,,,,,,32,23,23,0,1,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0009-9104,,,CLIN EXP IMMUNOL,Clin.

Different monitoring zones were established in the city on the basis of pollution sources, traffic densities, and structure of built-up areas. At most of the monitoring stations, two-hourly ozone concentrations frequently exceeded 60-mu-g m-3 (0.03 ppm) during summer months. However, the zone dominated by residential colonies, offices, and cultivated land showed maximum O3 concentrations less than 60-mu-g m-3 (0.03 ppm). Higher concentrations of ozone were mainly recorded in warmer months between 11 am to 4 pm. The highest concentration (2-h mean) of 160-mu-g m-3 (0.08 PPM) O3 was recorded in the month of April at Zone I which was mainly due to emissions from heavy-duty automobiles. Monthly average ozone concentrations were significantly correlated with temperature (r = 0.69), relative humidity (r = -0.81), wind speed (r = 0.76), and atmospheric pressure (r = -0.46). The frequency distribution of 2-h mean ozone concentrations was close to the logarithmic normal. Maximum 2-h mean O3 concentrations in some areas of Varanasi city were above the limit that has been shown to cause significant vegetation damage.

These characteristics consists of spike-like features with an initial melted core segment about 100 angstrom wide.

In the present work, porosity is introduced to the carbon nitride material using mesoporous silica material, MCM-41, as a hard template, and a mesoporous carbon nitride (MCN) material is synthesized. Further, the MCN is modified by immobilizing metal phthalocyanine (MPc, where M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn). The resulting MPc-incorporated MCN materials (MPc@MCN) were tested for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acidic and basic media. Detailed studies reveal that the FePc@MCN and CoPc@MCN materials exhibit higher ORR activity than the other composites in 0.1 M KOH. FePc@MCN follows a direct four-electron oxygen reduction mechanism and shows ORR onset potential (vs RHE) at 0.93 V (in 0.1 M KOH), which is very close to the onset potential exhibited by the state-of-the-art material, Pt-C (1.0 V), and higher than several similar composites of MPc with carbon supports tested in similar environments. Besides, due to the inherent property of coordination through nitrogen present on the MCN, FePc@MCN shows excellent stability even after 3000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles. FePc@MCN was found to have a better methanol tolerance in comparison to Pt-C in basic medium. CoPc@MCN shows a highly selective two-electron reduction reaction in both acidic and basic media at lower overpotential than many of the reported catalysts for the two-electron oxygen reduction. Therefore, these materials (FePc@MCN and CoPc@MCN) can be used as suitable alternatives to replace Pt and other expensive materials in ORR and related applications.","[Singh, Devesh Kumar; Ganesan, Vellaichamy; Yadav, Dharmendra Kumar; Yadav, Mamta] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Chem, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Ganesan, V (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Chem, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",velganesh@yahoo.com,"Ganesan, Vellaichamy/C-7529-2012","Ganesan, Vellaichamy/0000-0002-5241-5350; Singh, Devesh/0000-0003-4496-0903","DST-SAEAN program [IMRC/AISTDF/RD/P-16/2018]; CSIR, New Delhi","DST-SAEAN program; CSIR, New Delhi(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India)","Financial support from DST-SAEAN program (IMRC/AISTDF/R&D/P-16/2018) is acknowledged.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted on 50 women of reproductive age who had clinical and biochemical findings suggestive of PCOS. Clinico-hormonal parameters were recorded. Ultrasound and colour Doppler flow measurements of bilateral ovaries were performed in the early proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle. After assessment of the bilateral ovaries, colour Doppler ultrasound was used to evaluate the main uterine artery at the cervico-uterine junction. Follow-up imaging after 3 months was undertaken in patients who underwent treatment (metformin) and changes in the imaging and hormonal parameters were correlated. RESULTS: The mean value of luteinising hormone (LH) and the ratio of LH: follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) was significantly higher in PCOS patients. Ultrasound parameters were significantly higher in PCOS patients. Ovarian stromal vessels in PCOS patients had a significantly higher peak systolic velocity (PSV), low resistance index (RI), and pulsatility index (PI). The PSV of uterine arteries were significantly decreased and the RI and PI were significantly increased. On follow-up patients revealed changes in hormonal parameters. CONCLUSION: PCOS is a heterogeneous disorder and is a convergence of multisystem endocrine derangements. Ultrasound is good diagnostic tool for PCOS and the use of Doppler aids in the evaluation of haemodynamic changes in small vessels of utero-ovarian circulation and in response assessment.

At ambient conditions, the fruit cannot be stored for a long period due to fast ripening, abrupt softening and fungal growth. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of postharvest sodium nitroprusside (SNP) treatment, a nitric oxide donor, on senescence and physicochemical quality of guava fruit. Mature-green fruits were given immersion treatment of sodium nitroprusside (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mM) for 5 min while, fruits under control were dipped in distilled water for the same duration. After the treatment, fruits were stored at ambient condition (20 +/- 3 degrees C). Among the treatments, the best result with minimum weight loss (16.31%) and decay loss (22.22%) after 12 days of storage was noted in 1.0 mM SNP-treated fruits. Malondialdehyde content of fruits under this treatment also showed minimum increase of 5.3-fold indicating delayed senescence, as compared to control and other SNP-treated fruits. Fruits under this treatment exhibited delayed ripening, resulting minimum loss (53.23%) of chlorophyll, and slower increase in carotenoid pigments. Prestorage treatment of guava with SNP (1.0 mM) presented minimum loss of total soluble solids and acidity as compared to control fruits. The loss in ascorbic acid (21.30%), phenols (22.25%), flavonoids (26.14%), antioxidant capacity (25.61%), and radical scavenging activity (34.21%) was minimum in guava fruits treated with 1.0 mM SNP. The study indicated that storage life of guava at ambient condition can be prolonged by postharvest immersion treatment of 1.0 mM SNP.","[Sahu, Soubhagya Kumar; Barman, Kalyan; Singh, Anil K.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Agr Sci, Dept Hort, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Barman, K (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Agr Sci, Dept Hort, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",barman.kalyan@gmail.com,"Singh, Ashok/HGF-2506-2022; SINGH, ANIL KUMAR/M-4786-2017; Barman, Kalyan/ABE-6549-2020","SINGH, ANIL KUMAR/0000-0003-2933-4058; Barman, Kalyan/0000-0002-7056-435X","Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi","Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi","The authors are thankful to Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi for financial support and laboratory facility for conducting the experiment.",,69,9,9,4,17,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0137-5881,1861-1664,,ACTA PHYSIOL PLANT,Acta Physiol.

This specific behavior often limits the use of pollutants as a secondary carbon source by bacteria grown with preferred carbon source and the pollutants. Therefore, to develop an efficient bioremediation technology for removal/degradation of organophosphorus pesticide methyl parathion (MP) from agricultural soils, a soil bacterial strain (LMGR1) capable of degrading MP and p-nitrophenol was isolated and identified as aCupriavidus oxalaticusbased on biochemical (carbon utilization pattern) and molecular analysis (16S rRNA gene sequence), but the phylogenetic analysis revealed a distinct position, and the name was designated asCupriavidussp. LMGR1. The effect of preferred carbon source on degradation was also investigated. The bacterium assimilated the pesticide as a sole source of carbon and consumes about 100 mg L(-1)of MP within 6 to 7 h of incubation. Furthermore, the methyl parathion hydrolase (MPH) enzyme (localized in the periplasm of bacterium) activity was induced by the carbon deficiency instead of substrate. Determination of kinetic parameters, i.e., Vmax and Km for MPH enzyme in the extracted periplasmic protein indicated significant higher affinity towards the substrate. The reduced MPH activity in the bacterium grown in presence of preferred carbon source indicated the role of carbon catabolite repression in regulation of pesticide degradation. Thus, the bacterium has prodigious capability to be used as a bioremediation agent, but the availability of preferred carbon source may affect its potential in field application.","[Tiwari, Balkrishna; Sindhu, Vandana; Mishra, Arun Kumar; Singh, Satya Shila] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Bot, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Singh, SS (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Bot, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",satyashila@rediffmail.com,,,ICAR-AMAAS,ICAR-AMAAS,"We are thankful to the Head, Department of Botany, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India, for providing necessary laboratory facilities.

This work aims to evaluate the effects of cilostamide and rolipram (PDE 3A and PDE 4D inhibitors) on spontaneous meiotic resumption from diplotene arrest in rat oocytes cultured in vitro. For this purpose, diplotene-arrested cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) were collected from rat ovary. The COCs and denuded oocytes were exposed to various concentrations of cilostamide (0.0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10 mu M) and rolipram (0, 10, 50 and 100 mu M) for various times (0, 3, 5, 7, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 and 24 h). Cilostamide inhibited spontaneous meiotic resumption in a concentration- and time-dependent manner in COCs and denuded oocytes. Although rolipram showed inhibition of spontaneous meiotic resumption up to some extent, cilostamide was more potent to prevent spontaneous meiotic resumption in both COCs and denuded oocytes. Cilostamide significantly reduced PDE 3A expression, increased cAMP level and prevented spontaneous meiotic resumption in COCs and denuded oocytes. Although rolipram inhibited PDE 4D expression in cumulus cells, increased cAMP level but was not sufficient to prevent spontaneous meiotic resumption. We conclude that both drugs prevent spontaneous resumption from diplotene-arrest through PDE 3A/PDE 4D-cAMP mediated pathway. However, as compare to rolipram, cilostamide was more potent in preventing spontaneous resumption from diplotene-arrest in rat oocytes cultured in vitro. Thus, cilostamide could be used as a potential candidate for the development of female contraceptive drug in future.","[Gupta, Anumegha; Chaube, Shail K.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Zool, Cell Physiol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Chaube, SK (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Zool, Cell Physiol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",shailchaubey@gmail.com,"Chaube, Shail/ABC-1337-2020",,"Centre of Advanced Studies, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, UP; Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi, India","Centre of Advanced Studies, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, UP; Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi, India(Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR))","This study was partially funded by Centre of Advanced Studies, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, UP and partially by Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi, India.",,43,2,2,0,3,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0014-2999,1879-0712,,EUR J PHARMACOL,Eur.

Dye containing water effluent poses vast challenge to clean water before its discharge in to the surrounding ecosystem. Herein, we prepared humic acid functionalized Fe3O4 nanosorbents through an eco-friendly route and applied for decolorization of carcinogenic dye from water. The nanosorbents was characterized by AFM, BET surface area analyzer, FTIR, SEM-EDX, TEM, TGA/DTG, VSM and XRD. Adsorption experiments were conducted by taking the appropriate amount of dye in different sources of water under ultrasonication. Adsorption process was controlled by chemisorption in nature making pseudo-second-order model most suitable. Multilayer adsorption was taking place on the active sites of nanosorbents showing applicability of Freundlich isotherm model with highest adsorbed amount of 199.986 mg g(-1) at 323 K. Rise in temperature favors the remediation of colored effluent thus positive value of Delta H degrees (74.234 kJ mol(-1)) and negative value of Delta G degrees shows endothermic and spontaneous nature of adsorption system. Cationic surfactant CTAB favors the adsorption (<80%) while anionic SDS gives very low removal (>48%) because of the micelle formation at the surface of nanosorbents. Decolorization from real water samples shows that the adsorption of malachite green was 97, 90, 91, 87, and 86% for Ganga river water, tap water, well water, hand pump water and submersible water, respectively. The used Fe3O4/HA nanosorbents was easily recycled from water samples through 0.1 M HCl and nanosorbents was used up to five cycles with greater percentage of removal at 85%. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

(2013), the morphological features of the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) such as its magnitude and inter-hemispheric asymmetry have been studied during 2001-2009. The effect of solar activity on ability of the IRI-2016 model to predict the EIA parameters is studied and the results are compared with in-situ measurements from GRACE and CHAMP during high and low solar activity phases. The IRI-2016 generally follows the same latitudinal asymmetry (ACL - Asymmetry of Crest Latitude) at 400 km (the same trend of ACL as for CHAMP) while it tends to be asymmetric towards the North at 480 km (GRACE) (Positive ACL). In addition, during June solstice the IRI-2016 model shows larger departure from observation after 19:00 UT with a larger difference during high solar activity than that during the low solar activity. Also the IRI-2016 model failed to predict significantly North-South asymmetry (southern crest disappears) in the electron density for high solar activity period. This is probably the reason for larger discrepancy of observations and the IRI-2016 model particularly during the summer solstice of the high solar activity period. This suggests that data input in the IRI model particularly in the equatorial- and low-latitude regions are required so that it could better predict the location of EIA crests.","[Kumar, Sanjay] Banaras Hindu Univ, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Kumar, S (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Phys, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",sanjay.skitvas@gmail.com,,,"CSIR, New Delhi [13(9049-A)/2019]","CSIR, New Delhi(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India)","Author is thankful to CSIR, New Delhi for providing financial support under Scientist Pool Scheme (13(9049-A)/2019).

The molecular mass of purified Lsbgal was estimated similar to 76 kDa by Size Exclusion Chromatography on Superdex-200 (AKTA purifier) and on SDS-PAGE, showed hetero-dimeric subunits i.e. 45 kDa and 30 kDa. The purified Lsbgal showed glycoproteinous nature when applied to Con-A Sepharose chromatography. Biochemical studies revealed that optimum condition for purified Lsbgal against o, nitophenyl beta-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) as a substrate was pH 3.0, 58 degrees C with an activation energy (E-a) 8.1 kcal/mole and Q(10) 1.8. Lsbgal hydrolyses ONPG with K-m value 1.21 mM and V-max 90.90 mu moles/min/mg. Purified Lsbgal when incubated with high lactose concentration showed transgalactosylation activity which lead to the formation of trisaccharides as a major product of total GOS. Therefore, the purified Lsbgal could be used as potential alternative in food industry and would be further explicated for trisaccharides synthesis.","[Yadav, Anjali; Kayastha, Arvind M.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Sch Biotechnol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Kayastha, AM (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Sch Biotechnol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",kayasthabhu@gmail.com,"Yadav, Anjali/AAZ-3431-2020","Kayastha, Arvind M./0000-0002-5090-7159","University Grant Commission, New Delhi [F./2015-16/NFO-2015-17-OBC-UTT-32658/(SA-III-website)]","University Grant Commission, New Delhi(University Grants Commission, India)","Anjali Yadav is grateful to University Grant Commission, New Delhi, for NFOBC-JRF Fellowship (F./2015-16/NFO-2015-17-OBC-UTT-32658/(SA-III-website) for financial support in form of Junior Research Fellowship and Senior Research Fellowship.

The cultivation of climate resilient, adaptive and underutilized wild crops along with modern crop varieties is proposed as an innovative strategy for managing future agricultural production under the changing environmental conditions. Such underutilized and neglected wild crops have been recently projected by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations as 'future smart crops' as they are not only hardy, and resilient to changing climatic conditions, but also rich in nutrients. They need only minimal care and input, and therefore, they can be easily grown in degraded and nutrient-poor soil also. Moreover, they can be used for improving the adaptive traits of modern crops. The contribution of such neglected, and underutilized crops and their wild relatives to global food production is estimated to be around 115-120 billion US$ per annum. Therefore, the exploitation of such lesser utilized and yet to be used wild crops is highly significant for climate resilient agriculture and thereby providing a good quality of life to one and all. Here we provide four steps, namely: (i) exploring the unexplored, (ii) refining the unrefined traits, (iii) cultivating the uncultivated, and (iv) popularizing the unpopular for the sustainable utilization of such wild crops as a resilient strategy for ensuring food and nutritional security and also urge the timely adoption of suitable frameworks for the large-scale exploitation of such wild species for achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals.","[Singh, Ajeet; Dubey, Pradeep Kumar; Chaurasia, Rajan; Dubey, Rama Kant; Pandey, Krishna Kumar; Singh, Gopal Shankar; Abhilash, Purushothaman Chirakkuzhyil] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Abhilash, PC (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",pca.iesd@bhu.ac.in,"Dubey, Rama Kant/W-2802-2017","Dubey, Rama Kant/0000-0003-1576-0638; Singh, Ajeet/0000-0002-0666-9157; CHAURASIA, RAJAN/0000-0001-9561-9380; Dubey, Pradeep Kumar/0000-0001-5853-0619",Jawaharlal Nehru Trust; UGC; CSIR,"Jawaharlal Nehru Trust; UGC(University Grants Commission, India); CSIR(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India)","Authors are grateful to Head, DESD and Director, IESD for support and encouragement.

Increasing RM concentrations in manure-amended soil caused a significant increase in total metal contents but their phytoavailable contents decreased. A significant increase in plant growth performance and seed yield was observed up to 10% RM treatment compared to the control (without RM and manure). Maximum increase in seed yield (140.5%) of Pusa Bold and Kranti (120.3%) was found under 10% RM treatment. Metal contents in seeds were within the FAO/WHO safe limits.

The compositional variation of the various kinetic parameters in the present STSG chalcogen-rich non-oxide glasses Se78-yGeyTe20Sn2 (0 y 6) has been studied by means of the state-of-the-art differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) technique in the non-isothermal mode. The thermally assisted glass transition and crystallization phenomena have been investigated by examining the variation in various kinetic parameters like the characteristic kinetic temperatures (glass transition temperature T-g, on-set crystallization temperature T-o and peak crystallization temperature T-c), the activation energies involved in both phenomena, the thermal stability factor S and the glass-forming ability (GFA).

The individual and interactive effects of O-3 and sUV-B induced varying changes in both the cultivars of sunflower ranging from ultrastructural variations to growth, biomass, yield and oil composition. Reduction in leaf area of Sungold acted as a protective feature which minimized the perception of sUV-B as well as uptake of O-3 thus led to lesser carbon loss compared to DRSF 108. Number- and weight of heads plant(-1) decreased although more in Sungold with decline of oil content.

We assessed per cent root colonization, number of roots per plant, root length, root fresh weight, root dry weight and its effect on leaf starch content of micropropagated banana plantlets during hardening at 20, 40 and 60 days after mycorrhizal inoculation. The effect of mycorrhization on leaf nutrient (N, P, and K) was recorded at the end of the hardening period. Four treatments including control were replicated four times and 10 plants per replication were maintained in completely randomized design (CRD). Significant increase in number of roots, root fresh and dry weight of mycorrhized banana plantlets was recorded at 20, 40 and 60 days after inoculation over control. Though the numbers of roots remain significantly less in banana plantlets without mycorrhization, the root length was highest throughout the experimental period. Changes in root morphology of mycorrhized plantlets under water stress plays an important role in improved growth as number of lateral roots increase surface area for nutrient and water absorption. Significantly less leaf starch content after 20 days of inoculation in mycorrhizal plantlets were observed which increased significantly after 40 days of inoculation and continued up to 60 days.

The Brinkman model is used to simulate flow formation through porous media with small velocities. The study of flow systems composed of a porous medium and a homogenous fluid has attracted much attention since they occur in a wide range of industrial and environmental applications. Such flow systems occur with overland flow during rainfall, ground water flow, petroleum industrial processes, and electronic cooling, etc. The thermal energy equations corresponding to fluid and porous layers are solved by the separation of variables method. The velocity and the temperature fields are plotted as functions of the Darcy number, the Brinkman number, the viscosity, and the thermal conductivity ratio parameters to see the effect of these parameters. Each wall has large entropy generation due to fluid friction, and a similar result is also obtained around the interface, especially at the porous interface, while the central regions of fluid and porous medium have huge entropy due to heat transfer because of the large velocity and less gradient of velocity in these regions.","[Yadav, Shyam Lal; Singh, A.

There are no data regarding anal HPV infection and cytological abnormalities in HIV positive males receiving free therapy in the national program. Thus, this cross-sectional study was performed to assess the prevalence and risk factors of anal HPV infection and cytological abnormalities in HIV positive males.MethodsWe screened 126 HIV-positive male patients attending the antiretroviral treatment center (ART) between 2014 and 2015 with anal papanicolaou smear cytology and HPV-DNA testing. HPV-DNA was detected by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method with two consensus primer sets E6 and MY09/11 and further analyzed for the presence of various HPV genotype by Sanger sequencing. Risk factors associated with anal cytological abnormalities and HPV infection was analyzed by using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models.ResultsOut of 126, 52 were on antiretroviral therapy. 91% were married to female partners but during the study 48 (38%) gave positive history of anal intercourse with other men. Anal cytology was done in 95 patients, out of which 60 (63.15%) had cytological abnormalities. LSIL (low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions) was present in 27 (45%), ASCUS (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance) in 31 (52%) and ASC-H (atypical squamous cells cannot exclude a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) in 2 (3.33%). In multivariate analysis, the risk factors for cytological abnormality were presence of history of anal intercourse (OR, 6.1; 95% CI, 2.0-18.7) and WHO stage III & IV (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.1-7.5). HPV-DNA was detected in 33/119 (27.73%) patients. The most prevalent HPV type in the study was HPV-16 (10.08%), other HPV types detected were 18,31,35,17,66,72,52,68 and 107 (17.65%).ConclusionsHigh prevalence of anal cytological abnormalities in our study suggests that regular anal Pap smear screening should be done in HIV positive males in the ART center.","[Gautam, Abhilasha; Chakravarty, Jaya; Singh, Vijay Kumar; Chauhan, Shashi Bhushan; Rai, Madhukar; Sundar, Shyam] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Med, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Ghosh, Amrita] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Pathol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Chakravarty, J (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Med, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",tapadar@gmail.com,,"Chauhan, Shashi Bhushan/0000-0002-3268-852X","Center of Excellence (COE), NACO, India [M18017/72/2007/NACO (GF Rd. 6)]; UGC-Rajiv Gandhi National Fellowship (RGNF) [201314-RGNF-2013-14-SC-UTT-36942]","Center of Excellence (COE), NACO, India; UGC-Rajiv Gandhi National Fellowship (RGNF)","This work was supported by the Center of Excellence (COE), NACO (M18017/72/2007/NACO (GF Rd. 6), India.

The dominant rock types are charnockites, sapphirine-bearing granulites, garnet cordierite gneisses, and quartzites. Significant textural relations reveal multiphase reactions responsible for the formation of diverse mineral parageneses during prolonged metamorphic history of the area. Prograde reaction is evident from the textural relationship where biotite/sillimanite relics are seen as inclusion in garnet/orthopyroxene, suggesting dehydration reactions. The symplectitic assemblages that formed during isothermal decompression involve a series of cordierite-forming reactions, followed by retrogression and cooling. Variety of mineral assemblages present in the rocks of this area offer a wide spectrum of P-T sensors that provide details on the physical conditions of metamorphism. For the rigorous interpretation of the P-T path in the Perumalmalai area, quantitative phase diagrams (P-T pseudosections) have been constructed and contoured for the compositional as well as modal isopleths of involved mineral phases. The rocks of Perumalmalai area document a clockwise decompression P-T trajectory, consistent with crustal thickening followed by extensional collapse. SHRIMP U-Pb ages from zircon associated with sapphirine-bearing granulite facies rocks of Perumalmalai area suggest a widespread Ediacaran tectonothermal event. The occurrence of Ediacaran UHT metamorphism followed by isothermal decompression in the Madurai Block is consistent with the timing and physical conditions associated with the formation of East African Orogen during the amalgamation of Gondwana.","[Tewari, S.; Prakash, D.; Yadav, M.

The present study deals with the isolation and characterization of melanin pigment from bacteria. Three isolates showed pigment production and identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae S-1, Alcaligenes faecalis PBI and Enterobacter sp. ABI on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The maximum production of brown pigment (lambda(max) 405 nm) was attained after 6 days of growth in liquid medium containing 3 g L-1 of L-tyrosine. Solubility test, FTIR and ESI-MS analysis suggested the nature of pigment as melanin. Identity of pigment type from all the three bacteria was made by HPLC analysis, results showed the presence of homogentisic acid (HGA), a precursor of pyomelanin. All the bacteria showed high activity of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) suggesting its role in HGA synthesis. PCR amplification of gene(s) also showed the presence of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (hppD) gene coding for HPPD enzyme suggesting its role in pyomelanin synthesis. This study deals with only three bacterial isolates, isolation of such pigment from a large number of bacteria growing in harsh habitats may prove useful in finding novel type of melanin.

Reactions between these derivatives and the free radicals OH., OCH3., and NO2. via the HAT mechanism in the gas phase were studied using the transition state theory within the framework of DFT. Solvation of all the species and complexes involved in the HAT reactions in aqueous media was treated by performing single point energy calculations using the polarizable continuum model (PCM). The SET and SPLET mechanisms for the above reactions were also considered by applying the Marcus theory of electron transfer, and were found to be quite sensitive to geometry and solvation. Therefore, the geometries of all the species involved in the SET and SPLET mechanisms were fully optimized in aqueous media. The calculated barrier energies and rate constants of the HAT-based scavenging reactions showed that the OH group of the B ring in genistein, daidzein, and their methyl derivatives plays a major role in the scavenging of free radicals, and the role of this OH group in the HAT-based free-radical scavenging decreases in the following order: OH.>OCH3.>NO2..

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements confirm the cubic phase formation and shift in peaks position due to Bi3+ ions doping. The surface morphology of the prepared samples has been studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurement. The FTIR spectra reveal the information about the vibrational bands arising due to different molecules or species/groups. The Mg(0.943-y)Er.007Yb0.05BiyAl2O4 phosphor sample gives an intense upconversion (UC) green emission peaks centered at similar to 521 and 543 nm due to (S-4(3/2), H-2(11/2))-> I-4(15/2) transitions and the weak red emission at 660 nm due to F-4(9/2)-> I-4(15/2) transition. The emission intensity of green bands is enhanced by 30 times and the red band by 10 times on addition of Bi3+ in Mg ((0.943)) Er0.007Yb0.05Al2O4 phosphor. This increase in emission intensity also enhances the fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) of two thermally coupled levels emitting green radiation (i.e. FIR = I-521/I-543). The large variations of FIR with temperature clearly suggest that the material can be used as temperature sensor.

PMP are the most abundant microparticles present in human blood. In recent past years PMP have caught attention of many clinicians as well as researchers for being associated with many diseases like cardio-vascular diseases, infections etc; and have emerged as potential biomarkers. Owing to their small size and diverse phenotype, structure and functions, microparticles including PMP render many challenges during sample handling, estimation and characterization. PMP can be analyzed for many parameters like absolute count, size distribution, functions, content, surface proteins and other phenotypic characteristics. Many techniques have been invented to analyze PMP and other extracellular vesicles for these parameters, but none of them is capable of examining all parameters alone. Apart from it, every technique has its own advantages, limitations and sets of recommendations while using it. This often leads to applying multiple techniques in combination for accurately measuring various parameters and user has to decide cautiously which technique has to be used for their selected parameter testing. This review compiles various methods, techniques, challenges during PMP analysis and recommendations based on previous studies, aimed at guiding users for selecting the most suitable techniques for their experiments with PMP.","[Kailashiya, Jyotsna] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Biochem, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Kailashiya, J (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Biochem, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",jyotsnak@bhu.ac.in,"Kailashiya, Jyotsna/AAE-3958-2020","Kailashiya, Jyotsna/0000-0002-1631-0084",,,,,73,20,20,0,19,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0003-2697,1096-0309,,ANAL BIOCHEM,Anal.

The effect of IL content in MCM-41 was probed in terms of thermal stability, chemical interactions, and dielectric properties. N-2-sorption results indicate the compression of the IL in the nanopores of MCM-41, which contributes to an increase of the melting point probed by differential scanning calorimetry. The quantum chemical calculations confirmed that the ion-ion interaction in ion-pairs of IL were preferred over the hydrogen bonding interaction in the presence of SiO2 molecules, and these interactions probably compress the molecular size in the nanopores of MCM-41. Strong interactions between IL and porous MCM-41 were suggested as the mechanism of this immobilization, which was characterized by FTIR and dielectric spectroscopy.","[Tripathi, Alok Kumar; Singh, Rajendra Kumar] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Phys, Ion Liquid & Solid State Ion Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Singh, RK (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Phys, Ion Liquid & Solid State Ion Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",rksingh_17@rediffmail.com,"Tripathi, Alok Kumar/S-5151-2019","Tripathi, Alok Kumar/0000-0002-2019-2033; Singh, Rajendra Kumar/0000-0002-0168-1114","DST, New Delhi, India; CSIR, New Delhi, India [23/12/2012(ii)EU-V]","DST, New Delhi, India(Department of Science & Technology (India)); CSIR, New Delhi, India(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India)","RKS is thankful to DST, New Delhi, India for providing financial assistance.

The modification consists of replacing the usual shunt feedback connectivity by a secondary LC-tank of resonance frequency lower than that of the primary LC-tank which defines the feedback network. The secondary LC-tank works as notch filter for the feedback signal and introduces additional frequency nonlinearity. This results in sinusoidal amplitude modulation of the chaotic output at frequency equal to the resonance frequency of the secondary LC-tank. The modulation depth is controlled by the biasing current and the load resistance. The modified circuit exhibits varied chaotic self-modulation characteristics with respect to variations in the system parameters. The modification outlines an approach for embedding self-modulating chaos control that can be extended for developing novel parametric chaos modulators and demodulators with embedded reference signal for chaos synchronization.

Microorganisms synthesize these compounds and some enzymes either alone or in association with plants. Microbes residing inside the plant tissues, known as endophytes, also produce an array of these compounds. Endophytic actinomycetes act as a promising resource of biotechnologically valuable bioactive compounds and secondary metabolites. Endophytic Streptomyces sp. produced some novel antibiotics which are effective against multi-drug-resistant bacteria Antimicrobial agents produced by endophytes are eco-friendly, toxic to pathogens and do not harm the human. Endophytic inoculation of the plants modulates the synthesis of bioactive compounds with high pharmaceutical properties besides promoting growth of the plants. Hydrolases, the extracellular enzymes, produced by endophytic bacteria, help the plants to establish systemic resistance against pathogens invasion. Phytohormones produced by endophytes play an essential role in plant development and drought resistance management. The high diversity of endophytes and their adaptation to various environmental stresses seem to be an untapped source of new secondary metabolites.

This can be induced by a cholinergic antagonist scopolamine but the underlying molecular mechanism is poorly understood. This study of proteome profiling in the hippocampus could provide conceptual insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in amnesia. To reveal this, mice were administered scopolamine to induce amnesia and memory impairment was validated by novel object recognition test. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with MALDI-MS/MS, we have analyzed the hippocampal proteome and identified 18 proteins which were differentially expressed. Out of these proteins, 11 were downregulated and 7 were upregulated in scopolamine-treated mice as compared to control. In silico analysis showed that the majority of identified proteins are involved in metabolism, catalytic activity, and cytoskeleton architectural functions. STRING interaction network analysis revealed that majority of identified proteins exhibit common association with Actg1 cytoskeleton and Vdac1 energy transporter protein. Furthermore, interaction map analysis showed that Fascin1 and Coronin 1b individually interact with Actg1 and regulate the actin filament dynamics. Vdac1 was significantly downregulated in amnesic mice and showed interaction with other proteins in interaction network. Therefore, we silenced Vdac1 in the hippocampus of normal young mice and found similar impairment in recognition memory of Vdac1 silenced and scopolamine-treated mice. Thus, these findings suggest that Vdac1-mediated disruption of energy metabolism and cytoskeleton architecture might be involved in scopolamine-induced amnesia.","[Baghel, Meghraj Singh; Thakur, Mahendra Kumar] Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Adv Study, Dept Zool, Biochem & Mol Biol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Thakur, MK (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Adv Study, Dept Zool, Biochem & Mol Biol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",mkt_bhu@yahoo.com,"Baghel, Meghraj/AAG-5123-2021",,"Department of Biotechnology, Government of India; Department of Science & Technology, Government of India [BT/PR14311/MED/30/470/2010, BT/PR3996/MED/97/57/2011]","Department of Biotechnology, Government of India(Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India); Department of Science & Technology, Government of India(Department of Science & Technology (India))","Department of Biotechnology and Department of Science & Technology, Government of India, Grant/Award Number: BT/PR14311/MED/30/470/2010 and BT/PR3996/MED/97/57/2011",,73,8,9,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1050-9631,1098-1063,,HIPPOCAMPUS,Hippocampus,AUG,2017,27,8,,,,,845,859,,10.1002/hipo.22735,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hipo.22735,,,15,Neurosciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology,FA6KQ,28449397,,,,2022-12-21,WOS:000405552500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Prediction of scar dehiscence and scar rupture is vital in treatment planning and selecting candidates of trial of labor after a Caesarean section (CS). Purpose: To assess the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for evaluation of post-Caesarean uterine scar and to predict scar dehiscence during repeat CS. Material and Methods: Thirty patients with a history of at least one previous CS underwent pelvic MRI for assessment of uterine scar during a subsequent gestation, all of whom underwent lower segment Caesarean section (LSCS) subsequently due to one of the established indications of CSs. Thickness, T1, T2 signal intensity ratio (SER), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value of scar site were charted. The lower uterine segment was assessed and graded intraoperatively and findings were correlated with MRI findings. Results: A total of 30 participants were included in this study, of which nine were classified as having an abnormal scar (of various grades) based on surgical observations. T2 SER with a cutoff value of 0.935 showed the highest sensitivity of 100% and scar thickness value of 3.45mm showed highest specificity of 91% in prediction of abnormal scar. On drawing a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, T2 signal intensity ratio showed the highest area under the curve (AUC) closely followed by scar thickness values. Conclusion: MRI derived parameters may be utilized for differentiation of an abnormal post-Caesarean uterine scar from a normal one. Both scar thickness and T2 SER measured on MRI can be used to predict scar dehiscence. However, T2 SER can serve as a more standardized and objective criterion.","[Kumar, Ishan; Verma, Ashish] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Radiodiag, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Matah, Manjari; Satpathy, Gayatri] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Obstet & Gynaecol, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Verma, A (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Radiodiag, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",drdnv5@gmail.com,"Kumar, Ishan/M-5178-2019","Kumar, Ishan/0000-0003-4676-288X",,,,,23,10,12,1,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0284-1851,1600-0455,,ACTA RADIOL,Acta Radiol.,JUL,2017,58,7,,,,,890,896,,10.1177/0284185116675659,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0284185116675659,,,7,"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",EV6FR,27799572,,,,2022-12-21,WOS:000401865800017,View Full Record in Web of Science

The onset desorption temperature of ZrFe2-catalysed Mg(NH2)(2)-LiH-Li-4(BH4)(NH2)(3) is similar to 122 degrees C, which is 83 degrees C, 63 degrees C, and 28 degrees C lower than that of thermally treated 2LiNH(2)-1MgH(2), 2LiNH(2)-1MgH(2)-4 wt% ZrFe2, and 2LiNH(2)-1MgH(2)-0.1LiBH(4) composites, respectively. Native Mg(NH2)(2)-LiH-Li-4(BH4)(NH2)(3) absorbed only 2.78 wt% of H-2 within 30 min. On the other hand, the ZrFe2-catalysed Mg(NH2)(2)-LiH-Li-4(BH4)(NH2)(3) sample absorbed 3.70 wt% of hydrogen within 30 min and 5 wt% of H-2 in 6 h at 180 degrees C and 7 MPa H-2 pressure. Mg(NH2)(2)-LiH-Li-4(BH4)(NH2)(3) catalyzed with ZrFe2 shows negligible degradation of the storage capacity even after repeated cycles of de/rehydrogenation. The effect of ZrFe2 and Li-4(BH4)(NH2)(3) on a Mg(NH2)(2)/LiH composite has been described and discussed with the help of structural (X-ray diffraction), microstructural (electron microscopy), and vibrational modes of molecules through FTIR studies. The present results suggest that an optimum catalysis may originate from the synergistic action of an in situ formed quaternary hydride (Li-4(BH4)(NH2)(3)) and an intermetallic-like ZrFe2, which acts as a pulverizer cum catalyst.","[Shukla, Vivek; Bhatnagar, Ashish; Soni, Pawan K.; Vishwakarma, Alok K.; Shaz, M.

The abundance of Ct. longipedem increased while that of C. compressus decreased, with increasing soil pollution. Correspondence analysis reveals a close association between soil heavy metal concentrations and Ct. longipedem abundance, but this association is lacking in the case of C. compressus. Cataglyphis ants which occupy stress-characterized niches appear to be pre-adapted to tolerate heavy metal pollution. Higher concentrations of Zn and Mn in Ct. longipedem may contribute to the strengthening of the cuticular structures, necessary for nest excavation in the hard, arid soil and for single load carrying. C. compressus ants appear to be pollution sensitive. Their higher Fe content may be related to metal uptake via plant- derived liquids and species-specific regulatory mechanisms. The metal pollution index and biota-to-soil accumulation factors, calculated by using the ant body metal content of the two species, indicate an overall decrease of soil heavy metal concentrations with increase of the site age, which reflects the degree of pollution related to the mine site age. The concentrations of total and available heavy metals (Fe, Zn, Mn, Pb, and Cu) were significantly lower in the ant nest debris soil as compared to the reference soil. The results of the present study highlight the role of ants as bioindicators and in bioremediation of contaminated soil.","[Khan, Shbbir R.; Rastogi, Neelkamal] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Inst Sci, Varanasi 221005, UP, India; [Singh, Satish K.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Soil Sci & Agr Chem, Inst Agr Sci, Varanasi 221005, UP, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Rastogi, N (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Inst Sci, Varanasi 221005, UP, India.",neelkamalrastogi@yahoo.co.in,,,"Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, New Delhi","Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, New Delhi(Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), Government of India)","We thank the two anonymous reviewers for their constructive suggestions which greatly contributed to improvement of the manuscript.

Nowadays, in some places across the world, less amount of rain is observed, which affects human population in several ways, like shortage of drinking water, less production from agriculture fields, increase in pollution level, etc. Keeping this point in view, in this paper, a mathematical model for making artificial rain is proposed and analyzed. In the modeling process, it is assumed that water vapors are continuously formed in the atmosphere and are not condensed enough to form clouds. Further, it is assumed that aerosols (mixture of two or more) are introduced in the atmosphere to increase the process of nucleation of cloud droplets from water vapors and changing them into raindrops. The qualitative analysis of the proposed model is presented using stability theory of differential equations. It is found that model exhibits only one nonnegative equilibrium. The sufficient conditions for stability of the equilibrium have been obtained. Numerical simulation is carried out to see the effect of key parameters on the process leading to rainfall.","[Misra, A.

The experiment included application of herbicide (butachlor) alone or in combination with various soil amendments having equivalent amount of N in the forms of chemical fertilizer, wheat straw, Sesbania aculeata, and farm yard manure (FYM). Soil microbial biomass showed distinct temporal variations in both crop cycles, decreased from vegetative to grain-forming stage, and then increased to maximum at crop maturity stage. Soil MBC was the highest in herbicide + Sesbania aculeata treatment followed by herbicide + FYM, herbicide + wheat straw, herbicide + chemical fertilizer, and herbicide alone treatments in decreasing order during the rice-growing period. During wheat-growing period and summer fallow, soil MBC attained maximum for herbicide + wheat straw treatment whereas herbicide + FYM, herbicide + Sesbania, and herbicide + chemical fertilizer treatments showed similar levels. The overall trend of soil MBN was similar to those of soil MBC and MBP except that soil MBN was higher in herbicide + chemical fertilizer treatment over the herbicide + wheat straw treatment during rice-growing period. In spite of the addition of equivalent amount of N through exogenous soil amendments in combination with the herbicide, soil microbial biomass responded differentially to the treatments. The resource quality of the amendments had more pronounced impact on the dynamics of soil microbial biomass, which may have implications for long-term sustainability of rainfed agroecosystems in dry tropics.","[Singh, Alka; Singh, Mahesh Kumar; Ghoshal, Nandita] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Bot, Ctr Adv Study Bot, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Ghoshal, N (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Bot, Ctr Adv Study Bot, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",n_ghoshal@yahoo.co.in,"Singh, Major/P-9790-2019","Singh, Major/0000-0002-0247-861X","University Grants Commission, New Delhi, India [SR36-32 2008]; University Research Fellowships","University Grants Commission, New Delhi, India(University Grants Commission, India); University Research Fellowships","This research was financially supported by University Grants Commission, New Delhi, India in form of a major research project (No. SR36-32 2008) and University Research Fellowships to Ms. Alka Singh and Mr. Mahesh Kumar Singh.

To understand the molecular basis of protein hypersaline adaptation, a detailed analysis is carried out, and investigated the likely association of protein sequence attributes to halophilic adaptation. A two-stage strategy is implemented, where in the first stage a supervised machine learning classifier is build, giving an overall accuracy of 86 % on stratified tenfold cross validation and 90 % on blind testing set, which are better than the previously reported results. The second stage consists of statistical analysis of sequence features and possible extraction of halophilic molecular signatures. The results of this study showed that, halophilic proteins are characterized by lower average charge, lower K content, and lower S content. A statistically significant preference/avoidance list of sequence parameters is also reported giving insights into the molecular basis of halophilic adaptation. D, Q, E, H, P, T, V are significantly preferred while N, C, I, K, M, F, S are significantly avoided. Among amino acid physicochemical groups, small, polar, charged, acidic and hydrophilic groups are preferred over other groups. The halophilic proteins also showed a preference for higher average flexibility, higher average polarity and avoidance for higher average positive charge, average bulkiness and average hydrophobicity. Some interesting trends observed in dipeptide counts are also reported. Further a systematic statistical comparison is undertaken for gaining insights into the sequence feature distribution in different residue structural states. The current analysis may facilitate the understanding of the mechanism of halophilic adaptation clearer, which can be further used for rational design of halophilic proteins.","[Nath, Abhigyan] Banaras Hindu Univ, MMV, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Nath, A (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, MMV, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",abhigyannath01@gmail.com,"Nath, Abhigyan/E-9773-2012","Nath, Abhigyan/0000-0003-1253-7115",,,,,47,16,16,1,23,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0939-4451,1438-2199,,AMINO ACIDS,Amino Acids,MAR,2016,48,3,,,,,751,762,,10.1007/s00726-015-2123-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-015-2123-x,,,12,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,DE7LJ,26520112,,,,2022-12-21,WOS:000370817900010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Morphine is a drug used for cardiogenic pulmonary edema and its effect on Mesobuthus tamulus (MBT) venom-induced changes is not known. Therefore, we hypothesized that morphine blocks the MBT venom-induced augmentation of phenyldiguanide (PDG) reflex and pulmonary edema. Materials and Methods: Experiments were performed on anesthetized adult female rats. Trachea and jugular vein were cannulated, and the electrocardiographic potentials were recorded by connecting needle electrodes in limb lead II configuration. PDG (10 mu g/kg, IV, bolus injection) responses were elicited by bolus injection initially, after saline/morphine (1 mg/kg) and after injecting MBT venom (100 mu g/kg). The time-response area of the PDG-induced bradycardiac response after treatment was calculated as % of the initial PDG response area. At the end of experiments, lungs were excised for determination of pulmonary water content. Results: PDG produced bradycardiac response that lasted for >60 s. MBT venom augmented the PDG reflex response by 2.5 times. In morphine pretreated group, augmentation of bradycardiac response induced by MBT venom was absent. MBT venom increased the pulmonary water content, and the increase was absent in morphine pretreated animals. Conclusion: The results reveal that morphine prevents the MBT venom-induced augmentation of PDG reflex response and pulmonary edema. Thus, morphine can be useful in scorpion envenomation syndrome associated with pulmonary edema.","[Akella, Aparna; Tiwari, Anil K.; Rai, Om P.; Deshpande, Shripad B.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Physiol, Inst Med Sci, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Deshpande, SB (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Physiol, Inst Med Sci, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India.",desh48@yahoo.com,,,"Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR-ad hoc project), New Delhi, India; ICMR-Senior Research Fellowship","Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR-ad hoc project), New Delhi, India; ICMR-Senior Research Fellowship","The study was supported by the grants from Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR-ad hoc project), New Delhi, India.

In this study, we harvested teak trees in the tropical dry forest region of India in 10 D classes, measured biomass of foliage, branch, bole, and the total aboveground part, and developed regression models for the nondestructive estimation of foliage, branch, bole, and aboveground biomass with the help of wood density (rho), stem diameter (D), and plant height (H). Models used for the prediction of biomass of tree components were of the linear, logistic, Gompertz, and Chapman forms. These models explained more than 90% variability in the biomass of each component of teak. For foliage biomass only, the model with just D as the estimator exhibited greater R-2 and lower standard error of estimate and average deviation. For branch, bole, and aboveground biomass, the models including rho, D, and H had greater R-2 and lower standard error of estimate. Our study detected that logistic models are more appropriate for broad diameter ranges and linear models for small D classes. The regression models developed in our study can be applied separately for the 10 D classes, and this could minimize the error occurring during nondestructive estimation of biomass of teak in different D classes.","[Chaturvedi, Ravi K.; Raghubanshi, A.

In these theories the three propagation eigenstates are different from the three field eigenstates. The dispersion relation in an external magnetic field shows that, for a non-zero energy (omega), out of the three propagating eigenstates one has superluminal phase velocity upsilon(p). During propagation, another eigenstate undergoes amplification or attenuation, showing signs of an unstable system. The remaining one maintains causality. In this paper, using techniques from optics as well as gravity, we identify the energy (omega) interval outside which upsilon(p) <= c for the field eigenstates vertical bar gamma(parallel to)> and vertical bar phi >, and stability of the system is restored. The behavior of group velocity upsilon(g) is also explored in the same context.

In statistics literature, such hazard rate is known as the upside-down bathtub shaped hazard rate and propound in the various survival studies. In this paper, we proposed a transmuted inverse Rayleigh distribution, which possesses the upside-down bathtub shape for its hazard rate. The fundamental properties such as mean, variance, mean deviation, order statistics, Renyi entropy and stress-strength reliability of the proposed model are explored here. Further, three methods of estimation namely maximum likelihood, least squares and maximum product spacings methods are used for estimating the unknown parameters of the transmuted inverse Rayleigh distribution, and compared through the simulation study. Finally, the applicability of the proposed distribution is shown for a set of real data representing the times between failures of the secondary reactor pumps. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

A major factor influencing the successful implementation of any immunization program is awareness and public acceptance of the vaccine. The present study focuses on potential impacts of awareness created by media campaigns on vaccination coverage of hepatitis B. In this paper, a SIR model with vital dynamics in a population of varying size is investigated, which couples hepatitis B vaccination and awareness created by media within a single framework. It is assumed that media campaigns propagate awareness about measures requisite for escaping the chances of contracting hepatitis B. The awareness created by media motivates people to get vaccinated and attain full immunization against hepatitis B virus. For analyzing the model, stability theory of differential equations is employed. First, equilibria of the system comprising fractions of the population are obtained and their stability behavior is discussed. Then the asymptotic behavior of total population is discussed in detail. Three threshold parameters R-0, R-1 and R-2 governing the dynamics of infection and total population are also affirmed. The findings of numerical simulations are also in line with analytically obtained results.","[Sharma, Anupama; Misra, A.

PGPR strains e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa BHUJY16, P. aeruginosa BHUJY20, Pseudomonas putida BHUJY13, P. putida BHUJY23 and Pseudomonas fluorescens BHUJY29 were known as combined Pseudomonas culture (CPC). The treatment combinations of (CPC + Azotobacter chroococcum + Azospirillum brasilense + 60 kg ha(-1) P2O5) and (CPC + A. chroococcum + A. brasilense + 30 kg ha(-1) P2O5) showed greater significant (31.66 and 32.00 g pot(-1)) and (29.99 and 30.28 g pot(-1)) grain yield of rice as compared to control during first and second year pot experiments, respectively. The treatment combination (CPC + A. chroococcum + A. brasilense + 60 kg ha(-1) P2O5) was recorded significantly higher plant growth attribute, yield, nutrient contents in grain and straw of rice followed by combination of (CPC + A. chroococcum + A. brasilense + 30 kg ha(-1) P2O5), (CPC + A. chroococcum + 60 kg ha(-1) P2O5) as compared to control during both year of experiments. PGPR combination with 60 kg ha(-1) phosphorus (P) was found higher growth and yield; while PGPR with 30 kg ha(-1) P gave approximately similar results of growth and yield due to more availability of NPK in the soil by cumulative effect of PGPR activities in the rhizosphere soil. So that treatment combinations of PGPR with 30 kg ha(-1) P was found economically cheaper than the PGPR with 60 kg ha(-1) P. Hence, the treatment combination of PGPR strains of Pseudomonas culture with A. chroococcum + A. brasilense + 30 kg ha(-1) P2O5 may be used as more effective combination for rice production.

The procedure is based on linear-solvation-energy-relationship (LSER) parameters for target vapors, interferents and polymers. The procedure combines selections from three independent selection methods: heuristic-that selects polymers according to the maximum values of LSER parameters, principal component analysis (PCA)-that generates clusters of polymers according to similarity of their chemical affinities towards target vapors/interferents and selects those with largest dissimilarity, and fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering-that generates fuzzy clustering of polymers according to a fuzzy measure of similarity and selects those that define cluster centers. The principal component and fuzzy selections are based on treating the polymers as objects represented by vapors as variables in the LSER generated partition coefficient data. The selection criterion is that the polymers that appear in at least two subset selections made by the above mentioned three methods are the winners. A second round of selection can be made by repeating the same procedure after eliminating the first round selections from the original set. The quality assessment of subset selections in each round is made by simulating and analyzing sensor array responses for specific target applications. The procedure has been validated by analyzing 4 target identification tasks-explosives, chemical weapon agents, narcotics and drugs of abuse. The vapor pool is comprised of 15 target and 23 interferent volatile organic compounds of varied origins including building materials, vehicular emissions, soil, vegetation, body odor, plastics, paints etc. The efficacy of the procedure is demonstrated by simulating 3 prototype detection targets: bombs in public place, nerve gas use by fugitives, and narcotics trafficking.","[Verma, Prabha; Yadava, R.

In the present study, spinach (Spinacia oleracea L. var All Green), a C-3 and amaranthus (Amaranthus tricolor L. var Pusa Badi Chaulai), a C-4 plant were subjected to enhanced UV-B (280-315 nm; 7.2 kJ m(-2) day(-1)) over ambient under varying soil nutrient levels. The nutrient amendments were recommended Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), 1.5x recommended NPK, 1.5x recommended N and 1.5x recommended K. Enhanced UV-B negatively affected both the species at all nutrient levels, but the reductions varied with nutrient concentration and combinations. Reductions in photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and chlorophyll content were significantly more in spinach compared with amaranthus. The reduction in photosynthetic rate was maximum at 1.5x recommended K and minimum in 1.5x NPK amended plants. The oxidative damage to membranes measured in terms of malondialdehyde content was significantly higher in spinach compared with amaranthus. Enhanced UV-B reduced SOD activity in both the plants except in amaranthus at 1.5x recommended K. POX activity increased under enhanced UV-B at all nutrient levels in amaranthus, but only at 1.5x K in spinach. Amaranthus had significantly higher UV-B-absorbing compounds than spinach even under UV-B stress. Lowest reductions in yield and total biomass under enhanced UV-B compared with ambient were observed in amaranthus grown at 1.5x recommended NPK. Enhanced UV-B did not significantly change the nitrogen use efficiency in amaranthus at all NPK levels, but reduced in spinach except at 1.5x K. These findings suggest that the differential sensitivity of the test species under enhanced UV-B at varying nutrient levels is due to varying antioxidative and UV-B screening capacity, and their ability to utilize nutrients. Amaranthus tolerated enhanced UV-B stress more than spinach at all nutrient levels and 1.5x recommended NPK lowered the sensitivity maximally to enhanced UV-B with respect to photosynthesis, biomass and yield. PCA score has also confirmed the lower sensitivity of amaranthus compared with spinach with respect to the measured physiological and biochemical parameters.","[Singh, Suruchi; Agrawal, Madhoolika; Agrawal, S.

The dissociation mechanisms (concerted and/or sequential) for these channels are examined. Further, the angular correlation of different fragment ions and the geometrical structure of the precursor ion are studied. The kinetic energy release distributions for the observed channels are also determined. It is found that the pure Coulomb explosion model is insufficient to explain the observed kinetic release distributions. The mean kinetic energy release for these channels is compared with the available data reported by earlier workers who have employed different charged projectiles and sources of photons.","[Singh, Raj; Bhatt, Pragya; Yadav, Namita; Shanker, R.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Phys, Atom Phys Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Singh, R (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Phys, Atom Phys Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",shankerorama@gmail.com,"Bhatt, Pragya/S-1293-2019; Singh, Raj/HDN-1244-2022",,"Department of Science and Technology (DST), New Delhi [SR/S2/LOP-09/2006]; Council of Scientific and Industrial research (CSIR), New Delhi; Board of Research in Fusion Science & Technology (BRFST), Ahmedabad","Department of Science and Technology (DST), New Delhi(Department of Science & Technology (India)); Council of Scientific and Industrial research (CSIR), New Delhi(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India); Board of Research in Fusion Science & Technology (BRFST), Ahmedabad","The work was supported by the Department of Science and Technology (DST), New Delhi, under the research project SR/S2/LOP-09/2006.

In the present study, we investigated the differential responses of nonenzymatic antioxidants ascorbate (AsA), glutathione (GSH), and their redox pool as well as activity levels of enzymes of ascorbate-glutathione cycle in seedlings of drought-sensitive rice (Oryza sativa L.) cv. Malviya-36 and drought-tolerant cv. Brown Gora subjected to water deficit treatment of -1.0 and -2.1 MPa for 24-72 h using PEG-6000 in sand cultures. Water deficit caused increased production of reactive oxygen species such as O(2)a <...(-), H2O2, and HOa <... in the tissues, and the level of production was higher in the sensitive than the tolerant cultivar. Water deficit caused reduction in AsA and GSH and decline in their redox ratios (AsA/DHA and GSH/GSSG) with lesser decline in tolerant than the sensitive seedlings. With progressive level of water deficit, the activities of monodehydroascorbate reductase, dehydroascorbate reductase, ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and glutathione transferase increased in the seedlings of both rice cultivars, but the increased activity levels were higher in the seedlings of drought-tolerant cv. Brown Gora compared to the sensitive cv. Malviya-36. Greater accumulation of proline was observed in stressed seedlings of tolerant than the sensitive cultivar. In-gel activity staining of APX revealed varying numbers of their isoforms and their differential expression in sensitive and tolerant seedlings under water deficit. Results suggest that an enhanced oxidative stress tolerance by a well-coordinated cellular redox state of ascorbate and glutathione in reduced forms and induction of antioxidant defense system by elevated activity levels of enzymes of ascorbate-glutathione cycle is associated with water deficit tolerance in rice.","[Pyngrope, Samantha; Bhoomika, Kumari; Dubey, R.

P.",,,Evolution of the Paleogene succession of the western Himalayan foreland basin,GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Facies architecture; Provenance; Basin evolution; Paleogene; Himalayan foreland; Tectonics,,"The Paleogene succession of the Himalayan foreland basin is immensely important as it preserves evidence of India-Asia collision and related records of the Himalayan orogenesis. In this paper, the depositional regime of the Paleogene succession of the Himalayan foreland basin and variations in composition of the hinterland at different stages of the basin developments are presented. The Paleogene succession of the western Himalayan foreland basin developed in two stages, i.e. syncollisional stage and post-collisional stage. At the onset, chert breccia containing fragments derived from the hanging walls of faults and reworked bauxite developed as a result of erosion of the forebulge. The overlying early Eocene succession possibly deposited in a coastal system, where carbonates represent barriers and shales represent lagoons. Up-section, the middle Eocene marl beds likely deposited on a tidal flat. The late Eocene/Oligocene basal Murree beds, containing tidal bundles, indicate that a mixed or semi-diurnal tidal system deposited the sediments and the sedimentation took place in a tide-dominated estuary. In the higher-up, the succession likely deposited in a river-dominated estuary or in meandering rivers. In the beginning of the basin evolution, the sediments were derived from the Precambrian basement or from the metasediments/volcanic rocks possessing terrains of the south. The early and middle Eocene (54.7-41.3 Ma) succession of the embryonic foreland possibly developed from the sediments derived from the Trans-Himalayan schists and phyllites and Indus ophiolite of the north during syn-collisional stage. The detrital minerals especially the lithic fragments and the heavy minerals suggest the provenance for the late Eocene/Oligocene sequences to be from the recycled orogenic belt of the Higher Himalaya, Tethyan Himalaya and the Indus-suture zone from the north during post-collisional stage. This is also supported by the paleocurrent measurements those suggest main flows directed towards southeast, south and east with minor variations. This implies that the river system stabilized later than 41 Ma and the Higher Himalaya attained sufficient height around this time. The chemical composition of the sandstones and mudstones occurring in the early foreland basin sequences are intermediate between the active and passive continental margins and/or same as the passive continental margins. The sedimentary succession of this basin has sustained a temperature of about 200 degrees C and undergone a burial depth of about 6 km.

The latency was similar to the reflex apnoea induced by the vagal C fibre stimulation. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to examine the effects of chronic and acute exposure to BPA on cardio-respiratory reflexes elicited by phenylbiguanide (PBG). Acute and chronic experiments were performed on adult female rats. In chronic experiments, the animals were ingested with pellets containing BPA (2 mu g/kg body weight) or without BPA (time-matched control) for 30 days. Subsequently, the animals were anaesthetized and prepared for recording blood pressure, ECG and respiratory excursions. PBG was injected through jugular vein to evoke reflexes in these animals. In acute experiments, the PBG reflexes were obtained before and after injecting BPA/ethanol. Also vagal afferent activity was recorded in some rats. In time-matched control rats. PBG produced bradycardia, hypotension and tachypnoea over a period of time. The maximal changes were around 50-65%. In BPA treated group, the PBG-induced heart rate and respiratory frequency changes were attenuated significantly. Acute exposure of animals to BPA (35 mg/kg body weight) for 30 min also attenuated the PBG-induced responses significantly. The attenuation of the PBG reflex responses by BPA in acute experiments was associated with decreased vagal afferent activity. The present results indicate that BPA attenuates the protective cardio-respiratory reflexes due to decreased vagal afferent activity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

It is expressed in most human neoplasm, but is absent in normal and differentiated tissues. The purpose of this article is to overview the expression of survivin, effect of its expression in response to treatment, correlation with other markers and newer advancement in targeting survivin. Methods: A detailed search of Medline was carried out using the following search strategy: ((survivin) OR ((apoptosis) AND (inhibitor OR inhibitors))) AND ((breast) AND (neoplasm OR neoplasms OR tumor OR tumor OR cancer OR carcinoma)). Abstract of all articles thus identified were reviewed to identify the relevant studies, full articles of studies thus identified were then obtained and reviewed. All relevant data was extracted and tabulated. Results: Survivin expression by Immunohistochemistry was identified in 65.3% (55.2-90.0%) of the breast cancer patients among the identified studies while survivin mRNA by RT-PCR was identified in 93.6% (90-97%). Survivin expression has been reported to be associated with over expression of HER 2, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)/PAI-1. Conclusion: Survivin is over expressed in majority of breast cancers. The over expression of survivin is found to correlate with HER 2 and EGFR expression. Survivin expression has been found to confer resistance to chemotherapy and radiation. Targeting survivin in experimental models improves survival. More studies are needed on the role of survivin in multi drug resistance (MDR) in the presence of Pgp/uPA/PAI-1 and the impact of survivin over expression in triple negative breast cancer.

The motile J(2)s of A. tritici suffered nearly 82% mortality at 31 +/- 1 degrees C after 24 h of exposure while the mortality decreased to 77% at 20 +/- 1 degrees C on the 6th day. Pathogenicity trial of 13 isolates of C. anguillulae against the motile J(2)s revealed that this nematode is highly susceptible to infection. Comparative susceptibility of the plant parasitic nematodes to C. anguillulae further revealed that the fungus is more virulent to A. tritici than the other nematodes. These findings firmly established that the C. anguillulae is a highly virulent biological control agent of A. tritici which resolved the controversial issue about its virulence against a nematode belonging to order Tylenchida. Motile and non-motile J(2)s of A. tritici are equally good for the selective isolation of C. anguillulae. However, larger sporangia are produced in the motile J(2)s, hence, motile J(2)s should be preferred over the non-motile ones. Observations of the developmental stages of C. anguillulae in living J(2)s of A. tritici revealed that the development from zoospore colonization to release of zoospores from mature sporangia was completed in 22-24 h at 31 +/- 1 degrees C, whereas, at 20 +/- 1 degrees C the developmental stages were greatly delayed requiring 72-75 h for zoospore liberation. Pathogenicity and development of C. anguillulae in living J(2)s of A. tritici also proved that the fungus is a wonderful experimental tool which can be used as an example of excellent biological control in the class room.

X-ray diffraction patterns and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images verify the precipitation of nano-crystals. Emission of Er3+ enhances several times when Yb3+ ion is added with the matrix. The Stark splitting and the intensity of different emission bands increase to a great extent when we approach to ceramics from glasses via glass-ceramics. The intensity of the blue and green emission bands increases much faster than the red and NIR emission bands. Intense upconversion emission observed by the naked eye has been quantified in terms of standard chromaticity diagram (CIE).

Platelets were isolated from the blood of sitagliptin treated patients and controls. Patients with T2DM treated with sitagliptin for 1and 3 months, showed 10 perpendicular to 2% and 30 perpendicular to 5% inhibition of platelet aggregation, respectively. For the in vitro study, platelets from 10 normal humans (n = 10) were isolated. Platelet aggregation, intracellular free calcium and tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins were measured by aggregometer, spectrofluorometer and western blotting, respectively. Platelets pre-treated with 5 and 10 mu g/ml of sitagliptin, showed 25 +/- 4% and 40 +/- 6% inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, respectively.

What is the relationship of functional attributes with each other? Can leaf attributes singly or in combination predict the growth rate of tree species of TDF? Location: Sonebhadra district of Uttar Pradesh, India. Methods: Eight leaf attributes, specific leaf area (SLA); leaf carbon concentration (LCC); leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC); leaf phosphorus concentration (LPC); chlorophyll concentration (Chl), mass-based stomatal conductance (Gs(mass)); mass based photosynthetic rate (A(mass)); intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi); and relative growth rate (RGR), of six dominant tree species of a dry tropical forest on four sites were analysed for species, site and season effects over a 2-year period. Step-wise multiple regression was performed for predicting RGR from mean values of SMC and leaf attributes. Path analysis was used to determine which leaf attributes influence RGR directly and which indirectly. Results: Species differed significantly in terms of all leaf attributes and RGR. The response of species varied across sites and seasons. The attributes were positively interrelated, except for WUEi, which was negatively related to all other attributes. The positive correlation was strongest between Gs(mass) and A(mass) and the negative correlation was strongest between Gs(mass) and WUEi. Differences in RGR due to site were not significant when soil moisture was controlled, but differences due to season remained significant. The attributes showed plasticity across moisture gradients, which differed among attributes and species. Gs(mass) was the most plastic attribute. Among the six species, Terminalia tomentosa exhibited the greatest plasticity in six functional attributes. In the step-wise multiple regression, A(mass), SLA and Chl among leaf attributes and SMC among environmental factors influenced the RGR of tree species. Path analysis indicated the importance of SLA, LNC, Chl and A(mass) in determining RGR. Conclusion: A(mass), SMC, SLA and Chl in combination can be used to predict RGR but could explain only three-quarters of the variability in RGR, indicating that other traits/factors, not studied here, are also important in modulating growth of tropical trees. RGR of tree species in the dry tropical environment is determined by soil moisture, whereas the response of mature trees of different species is modulated by alterations in key functional attributes such as SLA, LNC and Chl.","[Chaturvedi, R.

The nonglycosylated enzyme has a molecular mass of 79.76 kDa (ESI-MS) and the isoelectric point of the enzyme is pH 7.7. Cotinifolin hydrolyzes denatured natural substrates such as casein, azoalbumin, and hemoglobin with high specific activity. The K(m) value of the enzyme was found to be 20 mu M with azocasein. The enzyme is not prone to autolysis even at very low concentrations. Polyclonal antibodies specific to enzyme was raised and immunodiffusion reveals that the enzyme has unique antigenic determinants. Maximum caseinolytic activity of cotinifolin is observed in the range of pH 7.0-8.0 and temperature of 50 degrees C. Using 0.2 mL of 1 mM solution of each metal ion, the purified protease was inhibited slightly by Ba(2+) and Mn(2+), moderately by Mg(2+), Ca(2+) and Cs(2+) and significantly by Zn(2+), Cu(2+) and Co(2+). On the other hand, substantial activation in caseinolytic activity was achieved by Ni(2+). The enzyme activity was also inhibited by EDTA and o-phenanthroline but not by any other protease inhibitors. Perturbation studies by temperature, pH, and chaotrophs of the enzyme also reveal its high stability as seen by CD, fluorescence and proteolytic activity. Spectroscopic studies reveal that cotinifolin has secondary structural features with alpha/beta type with approximately 9% of alpha-helicity. Easy availability and simple purification procedure makes the enzyme a good system for biophysical study, biotechnological and industrial applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

It is assumed that pathogens are transmitted via direct contact between susceptibles and infectives. It is assumed further that cumulative density of awareness programs increases at a rate proportional to the number of infectives. It is considered that awareness programs are capable of inducing behavioral changes in susceptibles, which result in the isolation of aware population. The model is analyzed using stability theory of differential equations and numerical simulations. The model analysis shows that, though awareness programs cannot eradicate infection, they help in controlling the prevalence of disease. It is also found that time delay in execution of awareness programs destabilizes the system and periodic solutions may arise through Hopf-bifurcation.","[Misra, A.

In neat liquid, the Raman peak appears asymmetric. The asymmetric nature of the peak has been attributed to the C=O stretching mode of the two conformers of(C2H5)(2)C=O having C-2 and C-2v point groups and the corresponding bands at similar to 1711 and similar to 1718 cm(-1), respectively. A careful analysis of the I-iso (isotropic component of the Raman scattered intensity) at different concentrations reveals that upon dilution with methanol, at mole fraction C=0.6, an additional peak in the C=O stretching region is observed at similar to 1703 cm(-1) which is attributed to the hydrogen bonding with methanol. A peculiar feature in this study is that upon dilution, the peak at similar to 1718 cm(-1) shows a minimum at C=0.6, but on further dilution it shows a blue shift. However, the other peak at similar to 1711 cm(-1) shows a continuous red shift with dilution as well as a maximum at C=0.7 in the linewidth vs. concentration plot, which is essentially due to competition between motional narrowing and diffusion phenomena. A significant amount of narrowing in the Raman band at similar to 1718 cm(-1) can be understood in terms of caging effect of the reference molecule by the solvent molecules at high dilution. A density functional theoretic (OFT) calculation on optimized geometries and vibrational frequencies of two conformers of neat (C2H5)(2)C=O in C-2 ad C-2v forms and the complexes with one and two CH3OH molecules with both the conformers was performed. The experimental results and theoretical calculations together indicate a co-existence of two conformers as well as hydrogen bonded complex with methanol in the binary mixture, [(C2H5)(2)C=O + CH3OH] at intermediate concentrations.

Two locations in the Varanasi district of India were selected as they had been under potato cultivation for the past one decade and the scab pathogen was well established. Among the various treatments, the Pseudomonad strain R1 when applied with vermicompost gave the best plant growth and yield along with maximum reduction in scab incidence and scab index. The strain R1 was later identified as Pseudomonas mosselii. The treatment also showed maximum activities of the antioxidant enzyme peroxidase (POX) and the first enzyme of the phenylpropanoid pathway phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) in a pot experiment till 72 h after pathogen challenge and then declined thereafter. Interestingly the activities of both POX and PAL were higher in the potato tuber peels, the active site of pathogen interaction, than in the potato leaves. The results revealed the potential of P. mosselii strain R1 in promoting plant growth as well as inducing antimicrobial mechanisms systemically in the host plants facilitated by the organic amendment in the form of vermicompost.

High ionic transference numbers (similar to 0.99) of the material confirmed its electrolytic behaviour. Conductivity and dielectric behaviour as a function of frequency has been studied. Conductivity follows 'universal power law' (sigma = sigma (0) + A omega (n) ) with exponent 'n' varying from 0.94 to 1.18. Cross-linking and plasticization increases long pathways motion of charge carriers, comparable to sample dimension. Humidity-independent behaviour (up to 80% relative humidity), of impedance and water intake by the system, indicates the system's potentiality as a promising candidate for humidity immune device fabrication. The addition of PEG has a twofold effect on the material's conductivity.

Many species of ants constitute an inexpensive, protein- and mineral-rich, unconventional human food source. Some ant species are also utilised in traditional entomotherapy by indigenous people, or as a complementary and/or alternative medicine, in many parts of the world. Recent biochemical and pharmacological investigations are increasingly providing evidence regarding the medicinal significance of ant species. The well-developed immune system and anti-microbial chemicals that evolved in ants for defence against pathogens can be exploited for the treatment of human diseases. This important taxon may have enormous potential for providing future benefits to mankind as a source of pharmaceuticals and as rapidly and conveniently farmed minilivestock, for an increasing human population.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Adv Study Zool, Insect Behav Ecol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Rastogi, N (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Adv Study Zool, Insect Behav Ecol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",neelkamalrastogi@yahoo.co.in,,,"University Grants Commission, New Delhi","University Grants Commission, New Delhi(University Grants Commission, India)","I thank Dr J.

Decalcified bone matrix (DBM) as a vehicle of antibiotics can serve the purpose, provided a minimum inhibitory concentration is sustained. Healing of the defect and avoiding the second surgery is another advantage. We studied the DBM as the delivery vehicle for vancomycin in controlling the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) osteomyelitis as well as healing of the cavity simultaneously in an experimental study. Materials and Methods: An in vitro study was conducted to optimize vancomycin impregnation in the DBM. For the in vivo study, a unicortical defect was created in the metaphysis of the distal femur in 18 rabbits. After contaminating the defect with MRSA, rabbits were divided into three groups. Group I (eight limbs) received no graft. Defects in group II (11 limbs) were filled with plain DBM chips and in group III (14 limbs), cavities were implanted with vancomycin-impregnated decal bone chips. Rabbits were assessed by clinical, radiological, histological, gross examination and bacterial load assay. High Performance Liquid Chromatography HPLC analysis of vancomycin in group III was done to assess the concentration in DBM chips. Results: In group I, the infection persisted throughout the period of the study. Group II showed the fulminated infection at the grafted site with DBM chips sequestrating out. Vancomycin-impregnated decal chips in group III did not show any sign of infection and eventually incorporated. The bacterial load study showed a progressive load change and HPLC revealed an effective antibiotic concentration up to 3 weeks in both in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion: Decal bone chips were effective as the local antibiotic delivery vehicle in preventing the MRSA osteomyelitis model. It eluted vancomycin significantly and the graft uptake was also excellent. Allogeneic decal grafts eliminated the need for second surgery and acted as an excellent delivery vehicle for antibiotics.","[Saraf, Shyam K.; Yadav, Awadhesh] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Orthopaed, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Nagwani, Santosh] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Med Chem, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Sen, M.

Deciduousness is a reflection of interacted effect of seasonal drought, tree characteristics and soil moisture conditions. The present study aims to document the diversity in leaf pheno-phases in terms of duration of deciduousness (which is reciprocal to growing season length), wood density, leaf mass per area (LMA) and leaf strategy index in 24 important tree species growing in the Vindhyan dry tropical forest in India. On the basis of phenological observations, the tree species were categorized into two main groups: leaf exchanging species exhibiting overlapping periods of leaf fall and leaf flush, and deciduous species whose timings of leaf flush and leaf fall differ resulting in a time lag (deciduousness) between the completion of leaf fall and initiation of leaf flush. Presence of wide range of deciduousness duration (from ca. a week to 7 months) among dry tropical trees indicates large variations in their growing season length. In the tree species studied, as the duration of deciduousness increased, leaf flushing period decreased significantly but leaf fall period showed little variation. Differing deciduousness in tree species exhibited substantial differences in their leafing (vegetative growth) pattern, as reflected by ratio of durations of leaf flush to leaf fall (leaf strategy index). Across different species, duration of deciduousness was significantly positively correlated with leaf strategy index, and significantly negatively correlated with both wood density and LMA. Wide variations in deciduousness, leaf strategy index, wood density and LMA in the 24 species investigated indicate considerable functional diversity in tree species growing in Vindhyan dry tropical region. Variation in seasonal duration of deciduousness among species is reflections of differences in tree functional traits like stem wood density, leaf strategy index and LMA.","[Kushwaha, Chandra Prakash; Tripathi, Shri Kant; Singh, Gopal Shankar; Singh, Kaushlendra Pratap] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Bot, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Kushwaha, CP (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Ctr Environm Sci & Technol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",kushwahacp@yahoo.com,"Tripathi, Shri Kant/F-4974-2012; Singh, K P/B-3678-2013",,"Department of Science and Technology, Government of India; Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, New Delhi","Department of Science and Technology, Government of India(Department of Science & Technology (India)); Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, New Delhi(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India)","The authors are grateful to the Head and Coordinator, Centre of Advanced Study in Botany, and the Coordinator, Centre for Environmental Science & Technology, Banaras Hindu University for facilities.

The ovary is innervated by seven pairs of nerves, originating from the paired sympathetic chain lying dorsal to the posterior kidney. Ovarian TH activity showed a significant annual variation (P < 0.001, one-way ANOVA), correlating with gonado-somatic index. Activity was low from December to February (resting phase), increased from March to July (recrudescent phase) and then decreased in post-spawning phase (August-November). The annual pattern was similar to that of the brain. An intraperitoneal injection of 100 IU hCG/fish induced significant periovulatory changes in TH activity with the peak rise at 16 h, and the activity decreased after egg-stripping (P < 0.001, one-way ANOVA). Brain TH activity showed similar periovulatory changes. The results suggest that catecholamine synthesis is increased during both ovarian recrudescence and spawning of the annual reproductive cycle, implying a functional role in ovarian growth, maturation and ovulation.

The surface morphology of the Ag-NEEs was assessed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM respectively). Further, nitrite (NO2-) is electrocatalytically oxidized at Ag-NEEs, which leads to a sensitive determination of NO2-. The fabrication, characterization, and efficient sensing of NO2- at the Ag-NEEs are presented.","[Pal, Manas; Ganesan, Vellaichamy] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Chem, Fac Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Ganesan, V (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Chem, Fac Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",velganesh@yahoo.com,"Ganesan, Vellaichamy/C-7529-2012","Ganesan, Vellaichamy/0000-0002-5241-5350","DST [SR/FTP/CS-49/2006]; CSIR, New Delhi, India [01(2098)/07/EMR-II]","DST(Department of Science & Technology (India)); CSIR, New Delhi, India(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India)","Generous funding from DST (SR/FTP/CS-49/2006) and CSIR (01(2098)/07/EMR-II), New Delhi, India, is gratefully acknowledged.

In an X-linked recessive manner, an AR mutation gets transmitted to the offspring through carrier mothers in 70% of cases, the other 30% arising de novo. However, reports on AR mutations amongst Indian patients with AIS arc scarce in the literature. This study reports mutations in AR from two Indian families, each having a proband with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) phenotype. Clinical, endocrine and cytogenetic evaluation of these affected children was performed. Mutational analysis was carried out by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis followed by sequencing. The two point mutations were in exon 5: p.M7421, familial in patient I and p.V746M de novo in patient 2. These are hitherto unrecognized mutations in our population. Similar mutational studies are suggested in patients with AIS, in order to identify their frequency and clinical severity in our population.","[Nagaraja, M. R.; Rastogi, Amit; Singh, S.

It is a superior pedicle based flap on the branch of occipital artery and lower arterial pedicle is sacrificed to gain the full length of the muscle. The oral part of the skin undergoes total or partial necrosis in many of the cases as this skin paddle receives its blood supply from a segment which is very far from the superior arterial pedicle. Patients and methods: We describe a technique in which we preserve the branch from superior thyroid artery to the lower half of the muscle while raising the flap which leads to augmentation of the blood supply of the flap and reduces the incidence of necrosis and superficial sloughing. A total of 32 cases underwent reconstruction with this flap. Results: The flap was used for floor of mouth defects in 8, tongue in 7, buccal mucosa in 8, base of tongue defects in 5 and lateral pharyngeal wall in two cases. Total flap loss occurred in 2, and loss of skin paddle in 5. Partial skin loss was seen in 3 cases. None of these 10 cases required secondary reconstruction as the mucosal defects healed by itself on prolonged nasogastric feeding and antibiotic cover. The final cosmesis was good. Conclusions: Preserving the branch of superior thyroid artery supplements supply of blood and increases the viability of the flap. This flap may be a good option in select cases of oral cancer.

The isometric contractions of spontaneously beating or paced (3.5 Hz) rat right atrial preparations in vitro were recorded. The cumulative concentration (0.01-3.0 mu g/ml)-response of venom on spontaneously beating atria exhibited a marked decrease in rate (by 55%) and an increase in force (by 92%) only at a higher concentration (3.0 mu g/ml). The venom-induced decrease in rate and increase in force were sensitive to atropine, N-omega-nitro-l-arginine methylester (NO synthase inhibitor) and methylene blue (guanylyl cyclase inhibitor). Further, nifedipine, a Ca2+ channel antagonist, blocked the force changes but not the rate changes induced by venom. In the paced atrium, on the other hand, a concentration-dependent decrease in force was observed, and at 3 mu g/ml, the decrease was 50%. Pretreatment with nifedipine, but not with methylene blue, significantly attenuated the venom-induced force changes in paced atrium. The observations of this study demonstrate that the venom-induced atrial dysrhythmia is mediated through the muscarinic receptor-dependent NO-G-cyclase cell-signaling pathways.","[Kanoo, Sadhana; Mandal, Maloy B.; Alex, Anitha B.; Deshpande, Shripad B.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Physiol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Deshpande, SB (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Physiol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",desh48@yahoo.com,,,"University Grants Commission, New Delhi","University Grants Commission, New Delhi(University Grants Commission, India)","SK wishes to thank University Grants Commission, New Delhi for the financial assistance.",,38,4,4,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0028-1298,1432-1912,,N-S ARCH PHARMACOL,Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch.

In anaesthetised rats, blood pressure, respiratory excursions and ECG were recorded for 60 min after the injection of venom in the absence or presence of antagonists. Injection of BT venom (1 mg/kg, i.a.) produced alterations in respiratory frequency (RF), blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). The changes in RF were manifested as immediate increase (40%) followed by a decrease (40%) and subsequent sustained increase (60%). In case of BP, the increase began around 40 s, peaked at 5 min (50%) and remained above the initial level subsequently. The bradycardiac response began around 5 min which peaked (50% of the initial) around 25 min and remained at that level. Thus, exhibiting immediate-tachypnoeic, intermediate-hypertensive and delayed-bradycardiac responses. Pretreatment with lignocaine, blocked the respiratory responses and attenuated the pressor responses evoked by venom. Pretreatment with capsazepine, vanilloid receptor 1 (VR1) antagonist, antagonized all the three parameters of cardiorespiratory responses evoked by venom. Whereas, ondansetron (5-HT3 antagonist) attenuated the pressor and bradycardiac responses significantly but not the respiratory responses. These observations indicate that the cardiorespiratory changes induced by intra-arterial injection of venom are carried by afferents in addition to somatic nerves, involving mainly VR1 receptors and partially by 5-HT3 receptors.

Aim: To present the clinical characteristics, radiological findings, operative approaches, and outcomes. Setting and Design: Of the 32 patients, the study was retrospective in 22 patients and in 10 it was prospective. Materials and Methods: Patients case records were analyzed. Diagnosis was established by magnetic resonance imaging of craniovertebral junction. Patients were evaluated by Yasargil grading and operative procedure was done accordingly. Results: In this series the tumors were multiple and had extradural extension and hourglass expansion. Surgical results were excellent in most patients when procedure was done early in the course of the disease. Best results in terms of complete removal and good neurological outcome were achieved with posterior or posterolaterlly located lesion. Of the 20 patients who had surgery by posterior approach, 19 (95) patients had improvement postoperatively, while one (5) patient remained unchanged. While of the 8 patients who had surgery by posterolateral approach, 6 (75) had improvement postoperatively, one had no change and the other had neurological deterioration. Conclusion: C 1 and C2 nerve sheath tumors are to be considered as a separate clinical entity.

N-nitro L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME - a NOS inhibitor) treatment substantially reduced NO production by testicular macrophages suggesting that testicular macrophages are one of the sources of testicular NO in the catfish, Clarias batrachus. Significant decline in NO production was also recorded following treatment of macrophages with the gonadotropin (GtH), growth hormone (GH) and insulin indicating that macrophage-produced NO is under endocrine inhibitory control. Treatment of Leydig cells with sodium nitroprusside (SNP) decreased testosterone (T) production. SNP treatment also remarkably suppressed the GtH, GH and insulin-stimulated T production by Leydig cells indicating that Leydig cell steroidogenesis is sensitive to exogenous NO. Further, effect of conditioned medium of testicular macrophages incubated with medium alone (non-treated TMCM) or GtH (GtH-treated TMCM) or GH (GH-treated TMCM) or insulin (insulin-treated TMCM) were also observed on Leydig cell T production. Non-treated TMCM as well as hormone-treated TMCM stimulated T production by Leydig cells; hormone-treated TMCM were more effective in stimulating T production than non-treated TMCM and/or hormones alone. These experiments altogether suggest that testicular macrophage secrete some factors, which influence Leydig cell steroidogenic activity through paracrine mechanism, and these paracrine secretions are under the endocrine control. Decline in NO in hormone-treated TMCM might also be one of the reasons for more stimulation in T production than that of hormones alone. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Frozen chloroform solution ESR spectra of the copper(II) complexes display significant Jahn-Teller distortion and dimeric behavior of the complexes in solution. FAB mass spectra of the copper(II) complexes also exhibit peaks corresponding to dimers. Molecular, pseudo-molecular, dimeric pseudo-molecular, and fragment ion peaks in unit resolution mass spectra have been identified with the help of their isotope distribution pattern expected due to natural abundances of the 63Cu and 65Cu isotopes. All the FAB mass spectral peaks from the fragment ions containing copper have been interpreted on the basis of isotope distribution pattern.","[Prasad, Ram Lakhan; Kushwaha, Anita; Gautam, Bhanu Pratap S.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Prasad, RL (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",rlp@bhu.ac.in,"GAUTAM, BHANU PRATAP SINGH/D-1364-2015","Prasad, Ram/0000-0003-4579-7191",UGC,"UGC(University Grants Commission, India)","The authors are thankful to the Head, Department of Chemistry, Banaras Hindu University, for providing laboratory facilities.

In the present study, a novel method based on multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed to detect H. pylori in patients suffering from gastrointestinal diseases. This method does not require steps of sonication, boiling, or centrifugation for obtaining DNA from biopsy samples, which are otherwise prerequisite in detecting H. pylori by PCR assay. Two hundred seventy-six patients were examined, of which 182 cases (excluding 36 patients having multiple H. pylori strain infection and 8 showing amplification of 16S rDNA only) were H. pylori positive. The dominant vacA genotype was s1 and m1 being present in 168 (92.3%) and 106 (58.2%) patients, respectively, followed by m2 (41.7%), and the lowest being s2 (7.7%). Detection of H. pylori by this method seems rapid, simpler, and suitable for both types 1 and 2 bacteria. Furthermore, genotyping of vacA and cagA genes could also be routinely performed in a large number of patients for diagnostic purposes. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Aging in general has been reported to affect methylation of gene, however, nothing is known on the age dependent variation in methylation of Fmr-1 gene. Using the brain tissues from male and female mice of various age groups and sex steroid hormones (testosterone or 17 beta-estradiol) as modulators, restriction enzymes Hpa II and Msp I and Southern blotting technique, we studied methylation of 5'-upstream sequences of Fmr-1 gene. Our data reveal that the methylation of the 5'-upstream sequences that include CpG islands in promoter and 5'-untraslated region (5'-UTR) gradually increases due to advancing age in both the sexes. 17 beta-estradiol lowers the methylation significantly in the brain of mouse of both male and female mouse in age-dependent manner where as testosterone does not affect it appreciably. The alteration in the methylation may be attributed to altered DNA methyl transferase (DNMT) activity as the age increases from young to old, and the 17 beta-estradiol may down regulate the DNMT activity in both the age and sex groups whereas the testosterone may not have similar effect on DNMT. Down regulation of methylation of Fmr-1 CpG island and/or 5'-UTR by 17 beta-estradiol might lead to derepression of Fmr-1 gene especially in old age. This finding on Fmr-1 methylation is novel and it might have implications in understanding fragile X related disorders and age-dependent alteration in LTP and LTD.","[Singh, Kanchan; Prasad, S.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Biochem & Mol Biol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Prasad, S (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Biochem & Mol Biol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",drsprasad_bhu@yahoo.co.uk,,,,,,,57,15,15,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-5729,1573-6768,,BIOGERONTOLOGY,Biogerontology,DEC,2008,9,6,,,,,455,465,,10.1007/s10522-008-9178-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10522-008-9178-y,,,11,Geriatrics & Gerontology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Geriatrics & Gerontology,368IH,18830682,,,,2022-12-21,WOS:000260614300010,View Full Record in Web of Science

The present study was conducted to identify the involvement of inhibitory system in 3-NPA-induced depression of spinal reflexes. Methods: The monosynaptic (MSR) and polysynaptic reflex (PSR) potentials were recorded at ventral root by stimulating the corresponding dorsal root in hemisected (sagitally) spinal cord from 4-8 day old rats. Effect of 3-NPA in the absence and presence of antagonists was evaluated on the reflexes. Key findings: Superfusion of 3-NPA (3.4 mM) depressed the reflexes in a time-dependent manner abolishing them by 35 min. The T-50 values were around 18 and 16 min for MSR and PSR, respectively. An NMDA receptor antagonist, DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (10 mu M) failed to block the 3-NPA (3.4 mM)induced depression of reflexes. Superfusion of bicuculline (GABA(A) receptor antagonist; 1 mu M), or strychnine (glycine(A) receptor antagonist; 1 mu M) antagonized the 3-NPA-induced depression of reflexes significantly. The T-50 values were 26 and 30 min in bicuculline and strychnine pretreated groups, respectively and were significantly greater than 3-NPA only group. Significance: The results indicate that 3-NPA-induced depression of spinal reflexes is partially mediated by GABAergic and glycinergic inhibitory transmission. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, we investigated interspecific variations in several morphological traits, the degree of crossability, productivity, and the sex ratio in 2 sibling species, Drosophila ananassae and D. pallidosa, and their hybrids. The present species pair is unique due to the presence of strong sexual isolation and the absence of postmating barriers such as hybrid inviability or sterility. The 2 sibling species significantly differed in the following morphological traits: thorax length, sternopleural bristle number, wing length, wing-to-thorax ratio, sex comb tooth number, and ovariole number in males and females. Interspecific hybrids also significantly differed from their parental species in all morphological traits. Further, the degree of crossability and productivity was greater with conspecific matings than with heterospecific matings. Moreover, we found no sex ratio distortion in interspecific hybrids suggesting that there are fewer genetic incompatibilities between these 2 sibling species.

It encompasses 11 open cast coalmines and six thermal power stations that generate about 7,500 MW (about 10% of India's installed generation capacity) electricity. Thermal power plants represent the main source of pollution in this region, emitting six million tonnes of fly-ash per annum. Fly-ash is deposited on soils over a large area surrounding thermal power plants. Fly-ashes have high surface concentrations of several toxic elements (heavy metals) and high atmospheric mobility. Fly ash is produced through high-temperature combustion of fossil fuel rich in ferromagnetic minerals. These contaminants can be identified using rock-magnetic methods. Magnetic susceptibility is directly linked to the concentration of ferromagnetic minerals, primarily high values of magnetite. In this study, magnetic susceptibility of top soil samples collected from surrounding areas of a bituminous-coal-fired power plant were measured to identify areas of high emission levels and to chart the spatial distribution of airborne solid particles. Sites close to the power plant have shown higher values of susceptibility that decreases with increasing distance from the source. A significant correlation between magnetic susceptibility and heavy metal content in soils is found. A comparison of the spatial distribution of magnetic susceptibility with heavy-metal concentrations in soil samples suggests that magnetic measurements can be used as a rapid and inexpensive method for proxy mapping of air borne pollution due to industrial activity.","[Tripathi, B.

The ascariasis is one of the most cosmopolitan intestinal parasite infections and it can be in inhospitable regions inhabited by human being, but its biggest prevalence is observed in the tropical and subtropical areas. Intestinal obstruction has been estimated to occur in 2 per 1000 ascaris-infected children per year. We are presenting a study emphasizing the conservative treatment for complete intestinal obstruction due to roundworms without sign and symptom of peritonitis and perforation. Methods. A total of 22 patients of roundworm obstruction partial or complete without signs of and symptoms of peritonitis were admitted in the Department of Pediatric Surgery IMS, BHU Varanasi India in the period form 2003-2005. Patients were put nil by mouth, intravenous fluid, antibiotics, piperazine salt through nasogastric tube and glycerine + liquid paraffin emulsion enemas and were evaluated for duration of hospital stay, rate of conversion to surgical treatment and complications. Results. 19 (86%) patients were treated successfully with conservative line of management. Only 3 patients required surgical intervention. No mortality, complication and mean hospital stay was 4.1 days (range 4-5 days). Conclusion. Round worm intestinal obstruction can be effectively treated by conservative line of management.","[Gangopadhyay, A. N.; Upadhyaya, Vijai D.; Gupta, D. K.; Sharma, S.

A murine transplantable T cell lymphoma of spontaneous origin, designated as Dalton's lymphoma, was used as a model tumor for this investigation. Tumor cells were harvested from the early (5 days after tumor transplantation) and late tumor-bearing stages (17 days after tumor transplantation), with or without in-vivo administration of the chemotherapeutic drugs, cisplatin or doxorubicin. Tumor cells harvested at the late tumor-bearing stages showed a higher proliferative ability in vitro. Tumor progression was found to be associated with a decline in the tumor cytotoxicity of the chemotherapeutic drugs. Similar results were also obtained when tumor cells were cultured at low (10(5) cells/ml) and high 0 09 cells/ml) cell densities in vitro in medium alone or in one containing the chemotherapeutic drugs. An increase in the expression of heat shock protein (Hsp70), vascular endothelial growth factor, interleukin-2 receptor and interleukin-2 proteins along with an inhibition in the expression of caspase-activated DNase and p53 proteins was observed during the late tumor-bearing stage and also in the Dalton's lymphoma cells when cultured in vitro at a higher cell density. The ascitic fluid obtained from the late tumor-bearing stage and the culture supernatant of tumor cells incubated in vitro at high cell density showed high levels of cell growth-regulating cytokines: interleukin-1, interleukin-2, interferon-gamma, vascular endothelial growth factor, tumor growth factor-beta and interleukin-10. In-vivo administration of cisplatin in tumor-bearing mice at the late tumor-bearing stage did not alter the level of these cytokines in the ascitic fluid. In view of the results of this investigation, it is suggested that under high cellular density-associated environmental conditions the tumor cells alter their growth properties depending on an alteration in the expression of cell growth and apoptosis-regulating proteins. Tumor cells, thus, switch to a high level of proliferation, which renders them resistant to the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Sch Biotechnol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Singh, SM (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Sch Biotechnol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",sukhmahendrasingh@yahoo.com,"Singh, Vivek/C-4574-2013","Singh, Vivek/0000-0003-3958-5635",,,,,45,15,15,0,5,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0959-4973,1473-5741,,ANTI-CANCER DRUG,Anti-Cancer Drugs,NOV,2007,18,10,,,,,1123,1132,,10.1097/CAD.0b013e3282ef5281,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/CAD.0b013e3282ef5281,,,10,Oncology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Oncology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,220CS,17893512,,,,2022-12-21,WOS:000250135100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

However it is possible that calculi may be incriminated by some means other than just chronic irritation. Calculi may induce an element of stasis, promoting chronic infection leading to increased turnover of primary bile acids to secondary bile acids, which are known tumor promoters and initiators. This study aimed to find the prevalence of biliary microflora in gallbladder carcinoma and association of gallbladder carcinoma with chronic bacterial infection and bile acid profile. Methodology: Bile culture was done in 390 patients divided into 3 groups - gallbladder carcinoma 65 (17%), cholelithiasis 125 (32%) and control group 200 (51%). Serum samples were analyzed for presence of Vi antibody for chronic typhoid carrier state and bile acid analysis was done in 10 patients in each group. Results: 116 (30%) patients had culture positive bile. Significantly higher number of patients with gallbladder carcinoma 40 (65%) had culture positive bile as compared to cholelithiasis 52 (42%) and control 24 (12%). Vi Antibodies suggestive of chronic typhoid carrier state were found to be significantly higher in the gallbladder carcinoma group 20 (31%) as compared to controls 22 (11%) (OR 3.596,p <0.05) however, the difference was statistically insignificant in the cholelithiasis group 12 (11%) (OR 0.859, p > 0.05). There was a 6.84 times higher risk of developing gallbladder carcinoma in culture positive cholelithiasis patients and 5.14 times if both Vi antibody and cultures were positive. Bile analysis showed primary bile acids cholic acid and cherrodeoxycholic acid to be lower while secondary bile acids deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid to be more in the gallbladder carcinoma group (7.268mg/mL, 9.183mg/ mL, 14.468mg/mL, 3.312mg/mL respectively) than cholelithiasis (17.50mg/mL, 13.80mg/mL, 6.07mg/ mL, 2.05mg/mL) and control group (19.85mg/mL, 16.53mg/mL, 2.71mg/mL, 1.128mg/mL respectively). The difference was statistically significant. Conclusions: Chronic bacterial infection of bile leading to production of carcinogenic precursors might be one of the etiological factors in the pathogenesis of gallbladder carcinoma and hence a target for its prevention.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Gen Surg, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Microbiol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Biostat, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Shukla, VK (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Gen Surg, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",vkshuklabhu@satyam.net.in,"Sharma, Vikas/AAE-5762-2020; NATH, GOPAL/GSN-5212-2022","Sharma, Vikas/0000-0002-7378-557X; Shukla, Vijay/0000-0002-2585-3478; NATH, GOPAL/0000-0003-2722-1308",,,,,19,29,32,1,4,H G E UPDATE MEDICAL PUBLISHING S A,ATHENS,"PO BOX 17257, ATHENS GR-10024, GREECE",0172-6390,,,HEPATO-GASTROENTEROL,Hepato-Gastroenterol.,SEP,2007,54,78,,,,,1622,1625,,,,,,4,Gastroenterology & Hepatology; Surgery,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Gastroenterology & Hepatology; Surgery,225CV,18019679,,,,2022-12-21,WOS:000250495600006,View Full Record in Web of Science

But its role has not been investigated in birds, where photoperiod plays an important role in regulating gonadal development. To investigate the effect of NO on gonadal and adrenal function of Japanese quail, in the first experiment, 3-weeks-old sexually immature quail received NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 5 mg/100 g body weight) orally or nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor N-nitro L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 25 mu g/100 g body weight) intraperitoneally for 13 days in continuous condition of light (LL). Thereafter treated quail along with their respective controls were shifted to long day length (LD 16:8) for 21 days when the study was terminated. Results indicate that SNP treatment stimulated and L-NAME suppressed body weight, cloacal gland volume (an androgen dependent sex accessory organ), testes (gonado-somatic index, spermatogenesis), epididymis (histology) and adrenal (weight, histology, cortico-medullary ratio) function as well as total nitrite and nitrate concentration in plasma, hypothalamus and testes. In the second experiment, two groups of 3-weeks-old birds were maintained in short day length (LD 6: 18) or long day length (LD 16:8) for 5 weeks to induce gonadal suppression and stimulation, respectively. Thereafter birds of both the photoperiod were divided into two subgroups, the short day quail receiving normal saline (SD Con) or SNP (SD + SNP) while long day quail received normal saline (LD Con) or L-NAME (LD + L-NAME) for 13 days and were maintained in their respective photoperiods, until the termination of study (21 days post treatment period). SNP stimulated all the parameters even in short day condition and L-NAME suppressed in long day quail compared to their respective controls. These findings indicate positive control of NO on the gonad and adrenal function of Japanese quail which exhibits parallel adrenal-gonad relationship. Further, NO donor induces long day effects while NOS inhibitor mimics short day effects. It is concluded that NO may not only regulate hypothalamo-hypophyseal-gonadal and -adrenal axis of Japanese quail but may also modulate its photosexual responses.

We report the influence of endogenous melatonin and testosterone on the daily variation in immunity of the Indian tropical bird Perdicula asiatica during reproductively active (RAP) and inactive (RIP) periods when the level of melatonin was high and in the former case. Daily variation in levels of melatonin, testosterone and immune parameters was noted during RAP and RIP. Maximum immune activity was noted at 2:00 hrs during RAP and at 14:00 hrs during RIP. During RAP, high testosterone in the circulation suppressed melatonin levels and immune parameters. A high basal level of melatonin during RIP was responsible for the suppression of testosterone resulting in high immune activity. Therefore, along with testosterone, melatonin acts like a major temporal synchronizer to maintain not only the reproductive rhythm but also daily immune adaptability of this avian species.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Pineal Res Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Haldar, C (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Zool, Pineal Res Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",chaldar2001@yahoo.com,,,,,,,33,10,11,1,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0929-1016,1744-4179,,BIOL RHYTHM RES,Biol.

Spore germination of all the test fungi was affected by the exudates reaching 100% in some cases. Foliar spray with exudates of isolate VL016 significantly reduced disease incidence of balsam (Impatiens balsamina) powdery mildew caused by Erysiphe cichoracearum and pea (Pisum sativum) powdery mildew caused by Erysiphe pisi, under field conditions. Characterization of exudates from 25 isolates of S. rolfsii revealed pH ranging from 3.8 to 5.3 and colour from light yellow to deep yellow. Among the phenolic acids found in the exudates were tannic, gallic, caffeic, vanillic, ferulic, chlorogenic and cinnamic acids. Oxalic acid was also found in varied amounts. Among the phenolic acids, ferulic acid was found to be present at high concentration in exudates of most isolates (3.9-153.4 mu g/ml). The antioxidant properties of phenolics, which generally inhibit fungal morphogenesis including spore germination along with the antifungal nature of some phenolics are chiefly attributed to the inhibitory effect of sclerotial exudates of S. rolfsii. Additionally, both the isolates VC971 and VL016 showed almost similar antifungal activities despite they are of different origin and thereby demonstrate the antifungal nature of sclerotial exudates.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Agr Sci, Dept Mycol & Plant Pathol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Singh, UP (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Agr Sci, Dept Mycol & Plant Pathol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",upneem@sify.com,"Pandey, Manoj Kumar/HHD-3365-2022; Sarma, Birinchi Kumar/GPX-1633-2022; Sarma, Birinchi Kumar/ABE-5555-2020","Pandey, Manoj Kumar/0000-0003-1446-9937; Sarma, Birinchi Kumar/0000-0002-1041-8422; Sarma, Birinchi Kumar/0000-0002-1041-8422",,,,,19,14,16,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0931-1785,1439-0434,,J PHYTOPATHOL,J.

Knowledge about the structure and dynamics of bacterial communities in soil has been limited as only a small fraction of bacterial diversity is accessible to culture methods. Traditional enrichment techniques and the pure culture approach for microbiological studies have offered only a narrow portal for examining the soil microbial flora due to their limited selectivity. Therefore, the morphological and nutritional criteria used to describe bacterial community failed to provide a natural taxonomic order according to evolutionary relationship. Molecular methods under an emerging discipline of biology molecular microbial ecology are now helping in getting these constraints removed to some extent. Nucleic acid extraction from soil is the first crucial step in the application of most of the molecular techniques, which have largely been dominated by diverse variations of PCR. Due to its rapidity, sensitivity and specificity, PCR-based finger printing techniques have proved extremely useful in assessing the changes in microbial community structure. Such techniques can yield complex community profiles and can also provide useful phylogenetic information. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) can be used to evaluate the distribution and function of bacterial population in situ. DNA microarray techniques have also been developed and being frequently used for the evaluation of ecological role and phylogenctic affiliations of bacterial populations in the soil.

Incubations of postvitellogenic follicles with PMA or OA alone did not induce oocyte maturation. However, co-incubations with 2-OHE2 and PMA (0.05, 0.5 and 5 mu M) or 2-OHE2 and OA (0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 mu M) increased germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) significantly over that of 2-OHE2- Incubation of follicles with calphostin C elicited varied effects on GVBD, low (0.005 and 0.01 PM) and high (5.0 and 10.0 mu M) concentrations did not affect GVBD, but medium concentrations (0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.5 mu M) stimulated it. The medium concentrations elicited a biphasic stimulatory response with peak GVBD at 0.1 mu M (54%). Calphostin C (>= 2.5 mu M) inhibited the 2-OHE2-induced GVBD in a concentration-dependent manner during the 24 h incubation. Pre- or post-treatment with calphostin C inhibited the steroid-induced GVBD only at 6 h. In co-incubation studies, both PMA and OA reversed the inhibitory effect of calphostin C: the former partially and the latter fully. The results of the present study show that PKC appears to modulate the 2-OHE2-induced oocyte maturation. The OA-sensitive PP may be involved in the PKC modulation of steroid-induced oocyte maturation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The ZnO nanostructures have been formed by evaporation of Zn (99.99%) in O-2 and Ar atmosphere in single zone furnace under two temperature regions, region A (similar to 1173-1073 K) and region B (similar to 873-773 K). Through application of XRD and TEM techniques, it has been shown that first ZnO is formed which changes to ZnOx through creation of oxygen vacancies. The ZnOx acts as self-catalyst and leads to formation of various nanostructures. Those observed in the present investigation are nanotetrapods (1D, diameter similar to 70-450 nm, length similar to 2-4.5 mu m) nanorods (1D, diameter similar to 45-95 nm, length similar to 2.5-4.5 mu m), nanoflowers(2D, central core diameter similar to 90-185 nm, length of petals/nanorod similar to 1.0-3.5 mu m) and nanoparticles (3D, size similar to 0.85-2.5 mu m). These nanostructures have been revealed by SEM explorations. Attempts have been made to explain the formation of the various nanostructures in terms of the creation and distribution of the ZnOx, the temperature as well as oxygenation conditions.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Phys, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Srivastava, ON (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Phys, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",,,"SINGH, Dr Jai/0000-0001-6016-3299",,,,,25,28,28,0,18,AMER SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHERS,STEVENSON RANCH,"25650 NORTH LEWIS WAY, STEVENSON RANCH, CA 91381-1439 USA",1533-4880,,,J NANOSCI NANOTECHNO,J.

Heavy metals are kept under environmental pollutant category due to their toxic effects on plants, animals and human being. Heavy metal contamination of soil results from anthropogenic as well as natural activities. Anthropogenic activities such as mining, smelting operation and agriculture have locally increased the levels of heavy metals such as Cd, Co, Cr, Pb, As and Ni in soil up to dangerous levels. Heavy metals are persistent in nature, therefore get accumulated in soils and plants. Heavy metals interfere with physiological activities of plants such as photosynthesis, gaseous exchange and nutrient absorption, and cause reductions in plant growth, dry matter accumulation and yield. Heavy metals also interfere with the levels of antioxidants in plants, and reduce the nutritive value of the produce. Dietary intake of many heavy metals through consumption of plants has long term detrimental effects on human health.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Bot, Ecol Res Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Sharma, RK (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Bot, Ecol Res Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",,"Sharma, Rajesh Kumar/P-1293-2016",,,,,,113,270,290,7,134,TRIVENI ENTERPRISES,LUCKNOW,"C/O KIRAN DALELA, 1/206 VIKAS NAGAR, KURSI RD, LUCKNOW 226 022, INDIA",0254-8704,,,J ENVIRON BIOL,J.Environ.Biol.,JUN,2005,26,2,,S,,,301,313,,,,,,13,Environmental Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,940SM,16334259,,,,2022-12-21,WOS:000230164400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We have also reported that progressive in vivo growth of DL resulted in an inhibition of macrophage functions. In present investigation we report that physical exercise by DL-bearing mice, on a treadmill on a daily basis for various time durations for 10 days, increased the life span along with an inhibition of tumor growth. A significant decrease in the volume of ascitic fluid and number of cells in the tumor was obtained in mice, which underwent exercise. DL cells obtained from exercised groups showed a decreased proliferation in vitro. An augmentation in the percent of cells showing apoptotic morphology and percent specific DNA fragmentation was observed, suggesting that physical exercise increased the incidence of apoptosis in tumor cells. Moreover, macrophages obtained from tumor-bearing mice, which underwent exercise training, showed an augmented tumoricidal activity and production of tumoricidal molecules like interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and nitric oxide (NO). On the basis of this study it is suggested that the regression of tumor growth consequent to physical exercise training of tumor bearing host, may be due to an exercise-dependent augmentation of macrophage tumoricidal functions.

The influence of various heat treatments: furnace cooled (FC), air cooled (AC) and water quenched (WQ) on the electrochemical polarization behaviour has also been studied for a few selected compositions of these acids and their mixtures in methanolic solutions. The cathodic reaction is observed to be hydrogen evolution. The alloy showed active, passive and transpassive behaviour in different concentrations of sulphuric acid in methanol. The anodic polarization curves of the alloy revealed a characteristic 'cathodic loop' in methanol at higher concentrations of sulphuric acid (0.1 and 1.0 M). Stable passivity was also observed which became ustable at higher potential due to pitting. Well defined anodic Tafel region followed by a limiting current density region, in different concentrations of methanolic solution of hydrochloric acid, was observed. However, in the mixture of different concentrations of sulphuric acid and hydrochloric acids in methanol and at higher concentration of sulphuric acid (1.0 M) the alloy showed active, passive and transpassive behaviour. Such behaviour was not observed below 1.0 M concentration of either acid in methanol, rather a limiting nature was observed. It seems that in the acidic mixture, the SO42- ions act as inhibitor and decreases the adsorption of Cl- ions and at sufficiently high concentration it effectively hinders the adsorption of the Cl- ions on the surface. The anodic polarization curves for FC specimen shifted towards higher current density region and the curves for AC and WQ specimens shifted towards lower current density region in comparison to as-received one in methanolic solution of sulphuric acid. However, the anodic polarization curves for FC, AC and WQ specimen shifted towards higher. current density region as compared to as-received specimen in methanolic solution of hydrochloric acid and in the mixture of hydrochloric and sulphuric acids in methanol.

HDC calculations provide several point charges near as well as far from the atoms in molecules. The HDC method preserves the contribution of each atom to the component of molecular dipole moment arising due to atomic orbital hybridization. Variation of total HDC with bond length showed a maximum or a shoulder near the optimized bond length in each case. The linear correlation coefficient between the optimized bond lengths and the positions of maxima or shoulders was found to be 0.81. According to the t-test, this correlation coefficient is significant at a level less than 0.5% showing that the correlation is meaningful. Thus it is concluded that bonding in molecules follows a principle that can be termed as Optimal Hybridization Principle (OHP). This-principle, like the Maximum Overlap Principle (MOP), can be used to explain bonding in molecules in a qualitative manner. The HDC components arising due to mixing of different s and p types of orbitals usually vary with bond length quite differently. Thus bonding is usually controlled by hybridization of some specific atomic orbitals in molecules which generally include those belonging to the next higher shell than the valence shell of the atom under consideration.

DNA sustained activation of p38/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and inactivation of p42/44 MAPKs. It is now reported that macrophages undergoing UV-B-induced apoptosis show enhanced expression of protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta) in a time-dependent manner. Pretreatment of macrophages with PKCdelta-specific inhibitor rottlerin prior to the UV-B irradiation inhibits activation of caspase-3, PARP cleavage, DNA fragmentation and release of intracellular Ca2+. Inhibition of PKCdelta also blocks the sustained activation of p38 and JNK MAPKs as well as inactivation of p42/44 MAPKs. PKCalpha and PKCbeta1 expression also increases during UV-B-induced apoptosis in macrophages. Inhibition of these two isoforms with Go6976 slightly suppresses caspase-3 activation. PARP cleavage, DNA fragmentation and release of intracellular Ca2+, but has no effect on the sustained activation of p38/JNK MAPKs or inactivation of p42/44 MAPKs. It is, therefore, suggested that activation of PKCdelta might play an important role in the UV-B-induced apoptosis and that specific activated isoforms of PKC may have distinct functions in cell death.

These dykes are spatially associated with the N-S trending deep-seated Nongchram fault and well exposed around the Swangkre-Rongmil region. The petrological and geochemical characteristics of mafic dykes from this area are presented. These mafic dykes show very sharp contact with the host rocks and do not show any signature of assimilation with them. Petrographically these mafic dykes vary from fine-grained basalt (samples from the dyke margin) to medium-grained dolerite (samples from the middle of the dyke) having very similar chemical compositions, which may be classified as basaltic-andesite/andesite. The geochemical characteristics of these mafic dykes suggest that these are genetically related to each other and probably derived from the same parental magma. Although, the high-field strength element (+rare-earth elements) compositions disallow the possibility of any crustal involvement in the genesis of these rocks, but Nb/La, La/Ta, and Ba/Ta ratios, and similarities of geochemical characteristics of present samples with the Elan Bank basalts and Rajmahal (Group II) mafic dyke samples, suggest minor contamination by assimilation with a small amount of upper crustal material. Chemistry, particularly REE, hints at an alkaline basaltic nature of melt. Trace element modelling suggests that the melt responsible for these mafic dykes had undergone extreme differentiation (similar to 50%) before its emplacement. The basaltic-andesite nature of these rocks may be attributed to this differentiation. Chemistry of these rocks also indicates similar to 10-15% melting of the mantle source. The mafic dyke samples of the present investigation show very close geochemical similarities with the mafic rocks derived from the Kerguelen mantle plume. Perhaps the Swangkre-Rongmil mafic dykes are also derived from the Kerguelen mantle plume.","Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Geol, Igneous Petrol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Srivastava, RK (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Geol, Igneous Petrol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",rajeshgeolbhu@yahoo.com,,,,,,,63,15,15,0,4,INDIAN ACAD SCIENCES,BANGALORE,"C V RAMAN AVENUE, SADASHIVANAGAR, P B #8005, BANGALORE 560 080, INDIA",0253-4126,,,P INDIAN AS-EARTH,Proc.

It is seen that the presence of the four peptide units attached to one of the pyranose rings considerably affects the minimum energy conformation of the N-acetylglucosamine (NAG)-N-acetyl muramic acid (NAM) units obtained in earlier work. However, in agreement with the result of earlier theoretical studies the AM1 method also disfavours a chitin like structure for the glycan moiety of the peptidoglycan. It is also found that in the minimum energy conformation there is a likelihood of formation of several hydrogen bonds between the sidegroups which might further stabilize the structure. The net atomic charges do not seem to be much affected as the conformation changes. The serine unit in the cell wall transmidase enzyme plays an important role in cross linking the peptide tails of successive NAG-NAM units in order to form the bacterial cell wall. A calculation of the total energy of serine + the peptide tail as a function of their separation yields an estimate of the strength of relevant interaction. It is found that this interaction is almost equal in strength to the interaction between serine and a molecule of penicillin. It is inferred that because of this equality the presence of penicillin negatively affects the formation of cell wall in bacteria. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.
